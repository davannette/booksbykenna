Sometimes there are minor characters in my books that make us want more. Early this year, I asked my readers to tell me what they wanted for Alex MacFarlane from [The Uni Student](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076NRVM5M/ "The Uni Student"). The response to [Have You Met ... Alex]({{ site.baseurl }}/book-summary/have-you-met-alex.html "Have You Met ... Alex") blew me away.

Then in February, I published [Have You Met ... Scout]({{ site.baseurl }}/book-summary/have-you-met-scout.html "Have You Met ... Scout") about one of my sexy military men. Then in March, I asked my readers who they wanted for former politicial staffer Christopher Lowe from  [The Politician's Wife](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D67WJ1F/ "The Politician's Wife"). You might not love politics, but you loved [Have You Met ... Chris]({{ site.baseurl }}/book-summary/have-you-met-chris.html "Have You Met ... Chris"). 

Now, I've gone back to one of my earlier choose your own romances, The Question Is and given piano player Tony the short but not sweet romance you asked for.

## Have you met ... Tony?

Tony de Marco finished up his last set for the night to the empty applause of a few diehard fans and ignored by people who were more interested in getting last drinks than listening to him sing at the piano. The night hadn’t been a complete waste; he made almost as much in tips from playing requests as he did from the appearance money. Still, it didn’t make him feel any more like the professional musician or songwriter that he once aspired to be.

As he packed up to go home to an empty house and life, one of the bar staff pulled on an old sweater with ANU emblazoned on the front. That was all he needed, another reminder of the stupid choices he’d made in life. Turning down a musical scholarship at the Australian National University where he could have followed his early classical training for the dream of becoming a rock-star. Yes, back then Tony still had dreams of turning his talent into success, fame and more money than he could spend. All he needed was for the right person to see his gig. One lucky break and Tony knew what he’d do with it. 

Instead, he was closer to thirty than twenty and resigned to a musical career played out night after night in different clubs, restaurants and venues. Belting out the same old songs that the punters never tired of demanding. Each night finding him tired and emotionally exhausted from leaving everything on stage, before suffering through the same regrets during the packing up. Then going home either with a random woman who didn’t know any better – or who wanted to prove to her friends that she could nail the singer – or alone. Some nights Tony didn’t even know which was worse.


Tonight, he’d been visited by a small posse of fans, a gaggle of girls in their early 20s who spent their nights clinging to a cheap drink, flirting with the bar staff and twirling their hair hoping to get his attention. They’d been following him around the club scene for a couple of months and if he had any sense, he’d have worked his way through them by now. Let them find and move onto their next target. Instead, he felt trapped up on stage, prey to their whim. 

“Hi, Tony.” The tall brunette with the long face and name he could never remember was the first to greet him. 

“Good evening, ladies,” he made sure to include them all.

“That was great, I loved the way you got the old couple up so the guy could sing to his wife,” Angie enthused. Stunning girl, petite and blonde but so full of bubbly energy that at the end of the night, he’d rather run a mile than listen to her for five minutes.

“Excuse me, I need to pack up the van.” 

By the time he got back for the last of his kit, most of the group had made their way onto another club. The night was young and so were they. Tony remembered the couple who would have been in their fifties, celebrating their twentieth wedding anniversary. It didn’t take much for Tony to accompany the guy who wanted to dedicate their wedding song to his wife. Couples like that made Tony still believe in love – and realise that he wasn’t likely to find it working stupid hours and never staying in one place for too long.

Life of a musician was only romantic in the movies.

Most of his friends were just as broke and worked just as hard.

“That was a good night, except for the flat bit in the middle,” a mousy brown haired woman suggested from her wheelchair. 

“Ouch, that’s a bit harsh,” he smiled. Rose always seemed interested in his songs, sometimes closing her eyes to listen harder. Usually she hung out with but slightly separated from the posse of girls. “How are you, Rose?”

“If you want your ego stroked, ask the other girls.”

“I didn’t even ask your opinion.”

“I know, I give it freely and without any obligation for you to do anything with it.”

Tony pulled up a chair next to her, he’d always found her to be a refreshing ray of sun shine. A spring shower – freshening his world and filling him with an energy and enthusiasm he desperately needed. 

“So, tell me what you heard.”

The bar staff offered them coffees and microwaved burgers. At the end of the night, those who were left became a mixed-up family recapping the drunken antics from earlier in the evening. Rose wasn’t one of them, but somehow, she fit in anyway. 

“The moment you got asked to play your medley of 80s love songs.”

Tony laughed, “I thought I hid my feelings better than that. I played the songs.”

“If you call hitting the notes and singing the words ‘playing the songs,’ then I guess you did. It took you almost half a set to get your attitude adjusted afterwards.”

“That obvious?”

“Only to someone who was listening. You’re better than a half assed effort.”

“What about the old guy?”

“At least he sang with passion, you should try it some time.”

“I think that’s my cue to grab my pay and go home. Are you alright for a lift?” Not that he knew what she needed, but it seemed the right thing to ask.

“I’m fine. See you next time.”

Rose, sweet Rose. Tony didn’t want to admit it, but she probably knew him better than anyone and was the only one still in his life that didn’t let him get away with bullshit. Like tonight. He was the first to admit that some of the crowd favorites had become played to death which was reflected in the mechanical way he played them.

He’d started looking for her in every crowd, and sometimes when he needed to focus on one person for a song, she was a safe option. Yes, they were becoming friendly but he’d never considered how to date someone in a wheelchair. Still, she was a nice enough friend and he always made sure that if she was in the crowd that is stopped by to at least say hello.


It was almost two am by the time Tony arrived to his small unit in the western suburbs of Sydney. Cheap and nasty, it was his only non-musical extravagance. He’d ripped out all the walling the week after getting the keys and stuffed the internal walls with sound proof batts. Ideal for sleeping during the day and playing around with his keyboard at night. The neighbours didn’t even notice when he had friends around for some jamming sessions. A small price to pay to hold onto fragments of his dream. When he and his musician friends got together, it was easy to pretend they were all still young with the world at their feet. Instead of aging has-beens and never-beens.

“_Hi, sexy. How was tonight?_” If it wasn’t talking with Rose, the highlight of his life was the nightly message on his social media account from the mysterious, “Teasing Georgia.”

“_Fine how was your night_,” he replied, watching his laptop bubble away while he decided between another coffee or a hot chocolate. Sometimes, they could chat online for hours. 

“_Just chilling listening to music. How was the crowd?_” The lovely Teasing Georgia was in a chatty mood. Tony put away the chocolate powder and turned on the coffee machine.

“_Better than I deserved._” Tony knew that giving her a simple “OK,” wouldn’t be enough detail. Pushy wench, he smiled. Then again, Rose’s comments about him being flat had hit a nerve. “_I think I need to own my playlist and do less requests_,” he typed before Teasing Georgia had time to respond.

“_Why would you do that?_”

Why indeed? He could hardly blame it on the random musings of a girl in a wheelchair. Even if she was right. “_Because I keep getting asked the same songs that I’ve been playing for 15 years._”

“_Why?_”

“_Why what?_”

“_Why do you keep playing them?_”

“_Because people keep bloody requesting them,_” his keyboard snapped. Some nights she asked the dumbest questions.

“_Why?_”

“_Why what?_” Tony had his coffee, he could play this game all night – but could Teasing Georgia?

“_Why do they keep requesting the songs if they’re bad songs?_”

“_They’re not bad songs. I’m sick of playing the same songs night after night._”

“_What’s stopping you from playing them like it’s the first time?_”

“_But it isn’t the first time,_” Tony started to regret the coffee. This conversation wasn’t going anywhere, and he could do with the sleep.

“_When was the last time you kissed a woman?_” Wow! Teasing Georgia’s last message hit him from out of the blue. Tony didn’t want to sound like a player but the truth was that he’d kissed more than his fair share of women – and most of them and had been at his concerts.

“_Last weekend, there was a blonde,_” he typed, pressing “send” before he could change his mind.

“_There’s always a blonde with you._”

“_What’s your point?_”

“_I assume you kissed women before – probably for at least 15 years?_”

“_Yes but,_” he replied, still not knowing how to continue this sort of conversation.

“_My point is that every woman is different. Every woman is going to respond to a kiss differently._”

Tony waited for her to continue, the logic hitting him over the head like a sledge hammer. 

“_Each crowd is going to respond differently to each song. Depending on whether they got paid today, laid off, fought or made up with their partner. The songs are popular because the words speak to people. Your job is to get a feel for the crowd and sing it the way they need._”

“_That’s a tough gig._”

“_That’s why you get paid the big bucks._”

He had to laugh at that one. Most professional musicians didn’t even make minimum wage from their music alone. “_What if it’s a love song?_”

“_Then find someone you can sing it for._”

Tony thought back to the times he’d sung to Rose, knowing that she was safe and understood.

“_That’s your advice? Sing to a woman?_”

“_Sing to a man, I won’t judge_ 😊”

“_Cheeky girl._”

“_Instead of treating each crowd the same and each gig like any other, go out and mingle before your first set. Get to know them and match the song to a person or group in the crowd._”

“_You mean, sing to someone like you?_” Tony responded without thinking about the consequences. He didn’t know Teasing Georgia. Who she was, where she lived or even what she looked like. All he knew was that each night he logged on hoping to see her latest message.

“_Ha!_” a quick response, followed by, “_When I imagine you with woman, she’s like the blonde you kissed last week. Classical blonde to your dark scruffy hair and muscles._”

“_Well tonight I don’t have a tall blonde keeping me company. I have a flat black keyboard with your name on it._” Tony decided it wouldn’t hurt to repeat his usual question, “_When am I going to meet you?_”

“_Or not._”

“_Seriously we’ve been having this conversation for months now. You know me better than I know myself. You’re even the reason I changed up some of my sets. When, not if, am I going to meet you?_” He hadn’t been so firm before, but it was almost three am and he needed sleep.

“_Like I’ve told you, life is complicated. If we meet, the mystery would be gone._”

“_I’m not seeing how mystery is working for me or not when all we’ve become are words on the keyboard screen._”

“_But when you look out into the crowd, I could be anyone. Goodnight._”

Tony knew Teasing Georgia well enough to know that any time he tried to bridge the divide between them, bring their friendship into real life or at least find out her real name, she closed down the conversation. He’d tried to track her down a couple of times. Getting as far as confirming she lived in or near Sydney and had been impacted by the electrical storm a couple of months ago. Not that he could get her to admit anything.

The two women in his life were driving him insane. The lovely Rose who invigorated him with an energy for living. And the enigmatic Teasing Georgia, the mystery woman who had quickly become his best friend.


The computer screen went black and the woman known by Tony as Teasing Georgia cried in frustration – why did she continue to do this when it was only going to end in her pain? Years ago she’d watched a TV show about people pretending to be someone that weren’t online. At the time, she’d been filled with judgement and scorn.

Now.

Life was completely different depending on how you looked at it.

Tony de Marco enjoyed her friendship, but when he pressed for more she really wanted to be honest but it was better like this. 

No. Nothing good could come from meeting, ever. Lately, no matter the personal cost, she encouraged him to kiss every blonde, brunette or random woman he met. Teasing Georgia was unavailable, and life was and always would be too complicated for them to be anything more than modern pen pals.

Yes, in a twisted logic, Teasing Georgia convinced herself that by being pen pals, they never needed to put a face to the words.

“_Good night, I think I’m falling in love with you,_” his words appeared out of nowhere.


Another night, another gig. Tony tried to channel Teasing Georgia. Changing up the songs, freestyling, making the lyrics more relevant to the crowd. At first, he got their attention in a bemused kind of way but when Rose winked, he knew he could make spontaneity work without losing his fans. Or at least losing Rose.

“How was that?” he asked at the end of the night, refilling Rose’ jug of iced tea so she wouldn’t leave. Since he was going to ask for her honest opinion, he felt he needed to bring a gift so she’d soften her judgement and protect his ego at least a little.

“The tea or tonight?”

“The iced tea of course!” If Rose was any other woman, he’d be full on flirting. But with Rose it wouldn’t feel right. She was a friend and too special a person to treat like any other woman.

“Have you ever tried it?” she asked.

“Not that I can remember,” he hesitated before taking the offered glass. 

“I could get used to that,” he admitted, liking the refreshing taste.

“It’s amazing what you can get used to when you try.”

“Are we still talking about the tea or are we talking about the mix up with the set tonight?”

“Well, the gig wasn’t your worst one,” she teased to his mock horror. “Seriously though, I like the way you made everyone in the room feel that tonight was the first time you played any of those songs.”

“I got some great advice from a friend.”

“Musician’s friend?” she asked lightly.

By now most of the room had cleared and their eyes were adjusting to the brighter lights as bar staff cleaned away glasses and cleaned down the tables. Tony didn’t want the night to end. As much as he couldn’t wait to tell Teasing Georgia how great her ideas worked, he wanted to bask in the warmth of Rose’s friendship a little longer.

“Hey, Tony. Got any plans tonight?” Tony looked up as a vaguely familiar blonde tried to drape herself around him.

“Sorry, sweetheart,” he said almost automatically. “I promised to see my friend home.”

He didn’t know why he wanted to use Rose as an excuse but once the idea took hold, and the blonde left, he wanted to see it through. A pathetic way to make sure the night didn’t end, and that Rose would get home safely. 

“How do you get home?” he asked.

“How do most people get home if they’ve been drinking – they catch a cab,” she answered as if he was an idiot. Then again, he’d never bothered to ask before.

“How are you getting home tonight?”

“I’m getting a cab. I came out thinking I’d have a few drinks but didn’t end up being in the mood. No car means getting a cab home.” 
“What are you in the mood for?” Again, if this was any other woman he would be flirting up a storm.

“You seem like you want to talk,” she offered.

Tony tried to think back to the last time he’d actually been the one doing the listening. What sort of artist was he if he had stopped listening to people? How could he write songs about life, the world and even love if he’d stopped trying to see through other people’s eyes

“I think there is a 24-hour coffee shop open around the corner. Can I top you up with all the iced tea you can drink?”

“Can I get chocolate cake with it?” This time it was Rose who lead the flirting and he didn’t even mind.

“Honey, you can have whatever you want on the side just have coffee with me.”


The woman known as Teasing Georgia logged on to her computer as soon as she awoke. To her disappointment, no messages awaited. Nothing to tell her about last night, whether her advice had upset him or whether he’d finally met someone and didn’t need an online friend anymore.

“_How was the gig?_” she typed and held her finger for a minute too long before changing her mind. One by one the letters disappeared from the screen. Perhaps it was time that Tony started their conversation.

“_Morning gorgeous,_” his words bubbled through mid-morning.

“_Morning yourself. How was last night?_” Now that he’d started the conversation, maybe one day it would be about more than Tony and his world.

“_Great. But how was your night? I didn’t see a message from you before I went to sleep and I got worried._”

Wow, that was unexpected. “_Just a quiet night with me and the TV._”

“_Anything that I should watch if I ever got a night off?_”

“_Yeah,_” and Teasing Georgia described a movie she had watched on the weekend.

“_I heard about that one. Meaning to watch it when I have time._”

“_You should,_” she encouraged. 

“_How about next time I get the night off, we pick the same movie and watch it together?_”

“_That would mean meeting in person,_” she laughed. He never gave up, and part of her didn’t want him to.

“_Well if you still don’t want to see my ugly face, we can watch the same movie but you at home and me at my place._”

Who the hell was this new improved Tony?

“_Sounds like a good idea but don’t you have an active social life?_”

“_It got complicated last night._”

“_How so?_”

“_I don’t know how to tell you._”

“_Start at the beginning. No judgement._”

“_But I feel weird talking to you about another woman._”

“_Don’t be,_” her heart stopped. “_We’re just friends._”

There was a long pause before Tony replied. “_Ok, here’s the thing my beautiful Teasing Georgia. I think you are absolutely amazing and in so many ways you are the perfect woman except you won’t let me meet you in person._”

“_What you’re saying is I’m a figment of your imagination. I am the perfect mirror of you._”

“_I didn’t say that._”

“_What does your perfect woman look like anyway?_”

“_I’m starting to think that she’s you._”

Teasing Georgia brushed away her tears so she could read the words Tony didn’t mean. It had been fun, but she needed to find the courage and end this charade before she got more hurt. 

“_You can’t._” Teasing Georgia sent a series of short messages before Tony could get a word in. “_You don’t even know me._” “_You close your eyes and imagine me as this perfect woman but you don’t know me._” Finally, she typed, “_I’m not perfect and I’m not perfect for you._”

“_For almost four months, I’ve been trying to rectify that!_” Tony wasn’t giving up without a fight. “_Come on, Teasing Georgia. I know you live nearby. I know that we like a lot of the same things. Why can’t we just meet for coffee?_”

“_I have to go. Bye._” Teasing Georgia quickly put away her laptop and got ready to go out. The most dangerous thing would be to stay in the house with internet access, vulnerable to the Tony who had decided to talk to her as if she was important in his life.

Locking her door, Teasing Georgia left to catch up with friends and put aside the mess she’d created online. The man she wanted thought he was falling in love with her. But how could he ever forgive her if the truth came out?


Tony couldn’t understand women when they were right in front of him and now his head was completely messed up over two different women.

Last night getting to know Rose had blown his mind. Hours spent actually listening to her instead of talking about his own life. He couldn’t get over how much respect he had for her as a woman and as a person. The longer they talked, the less he actually saw her wheelchair and the more he saw and felt the essence of Rose.

“Don’t you ever get frustrated?” he asked towards the end of the night. He had avoided talking about her disability, but hoped that by now she considered him a good enough friend to ask. “I mean, don’t you get annoyed that you can’t do so many things?”

“Like what?” her surprise was quite genuine.

He thought back to the club, “Like dancing?”

“Why do people dance?” she smiled, encouraging him to think rather than judge.

“To enjoy music.”

“I can still enjoy music and I can still move around a dance floor. I just do it differently.” She waited for him to catch up. “I mean do you dance the same way as everybody else or do you have your own style?”

Tony never thought of it that way. “I guess I’m always too busy making music to be the one out there dancing.”

“And I’m the one out there critiquing you, enjoying the music when you decide to play it with heart.”

“Then don’t you ever wish that you could just dance in somebody’s arms?” Tony asked before thinking. At least he stopped himself before saying, “my arms.” He’d already been imagining how it would feel to hold Rose’s slight body as they glided around the dancefloor.

“I didn’t dance when I could walk, so why would I dance now?” Rose finished her chocolate cake without offering him even a spoonful. “I don’t look at myself through the eyes of what I can’t do.”

Tony motioned for more tea and coffee as he sat back and listened to Rose talk about her life. If he was honest, she had more friends and more of a social life than he did. Nothing stood in her way for long. Not only did she have an enthusiasm for life, she took time to enjoy even the smallest things.

“Last month I went to the zoo.”

“Who with?” he wanted to ask who was there to look after her.

“On my own, it’s something I like to do. They won’t let me volunteer, but some of the staff know me and let me get closer than the normal public. If you watch the animals close enough, you can tell them apart by their personalities.”

He listened as she described her favourite meerkats and marsupials. “It is the happiest place in the world. You see these tired parents coming through with cranky kids and within minutes everyone is enthralled by the animals.”

“I haven’t been to the zoo in years.”

“Your loss,” she shrugged.

“Would you like to come with me?” Tony asked on the spur of the moment. “I really want to see the zoo through your eyes.” He didn’t mean to ask her out on a date, but when she hesitated, he took her hand. “Rose, would you come on a date with me to the zoo?”


Rose didn’t know what had happened to the self-indulgent Tony. She had heard the kindness in his voice before even seeing him on stage the first time. His tones spoke to her own pain and helped her accept the new normal of a restricted life. When he noticed her in the crowd, Rose tried to push him away, preferring to the imaginary and perfect Tony rather than the showman. 

Never did she expect the invitation to coffee after a gig. Or hours of talking while he listened. Asking her to go on a date was the final straw! 

“Sure, when do you want to go?”

“Well, it’s already today and we probably need to get some sleep. How about tomorrow?”

“I can’t,” she smiled her apology. “I’m volunteering at a clinic.”

“I didn’t know you volunteer?”

“It keeps me grounded, there’s nothing like helping other people to give you some perspective about your own life.”

“You are amazing, did you know that?”

“Even if I did, it doesn’t hurt to hear someone say it.”

“I’m packing gigs this weekend and I don’t want to wait until next week. How’s Thursday?”

“I can wait two days.”

“I can’t,” he said. “But I guess I’ll have to.”


Talking until the small hours with Rose and then opening up to Teasing Georgia, Tony breezed through the rest of the week until his Thursday date at the zoo. Rose had insisted they meet at the front gate, refusing to let him pick her up even in an accessible cab. 

With Teasing Georgia still refusing to even meet him, he tried not to feel guilty about spending the day with Rose ad enjoying every minute.

“You are beautiful,” he meant every word. Truly, her skin was flawless and eyes always bright as if she was about to discover a secret. The deep purple sweater made her blue eyes seem darker and he ached to see the curve of her hips in the tight jeans.

“Thank you, kind sir. You haven’t scrubbed up too badly yourself.” 

Greeting most of the staff by name, Rose showed him a side of the zoo he didn’t know existed. She even took over as a guide for a bunch of school children when the volunteer had to escort a young girl to the toilet.

“You were amazing with them,” Tony gushed when Rose returned to his side.

“It’s easy. Their minds are like sponges and its easy to get them enthused about the animals.”

“Do you want children of your own?” He didn’t even know if it would be physically possible.

“Only if they get the right father. I mean, its easy to have a baby, but I want the father to be strong enough to deal with all the hard times.”

“Like?” Tony thought about all the ways parenthood would be tougher in a wheelchair.

“Sleepless nights, teething and the teenage years,” she laughed. “Were you wondering if I can have sex, fall pregnant or change nappies in a chair?”

“I guess a bit of all three,” he flirted, wondering what it would be like. “Do you mind me asking these questions?”

“Until the other night, you never asked me anything. You’re just making up for lost time.”

Ouch.

True, but, ouch.

The rest of the day was spent in an easy banter and mild flirting. Tony hadn’t enjoyed a day so much in years.  The whole day, he kept thinking that Rose’s wheelchair would get in the way of them having fun, but instead she brought more joy to every enclosure. 

“What was your highlight,” she asked as the sun started to set on their day and the staff had already suggested they move towards the exit.

“I don’t know, maybe when we sang a spontaneous love song to the monkeys,” he smiled as Rose laughed her agreement.

“Yeah, I think I’ve heard you sing better!”

In that moment, Tony couldn’t help but bring his face down to hers. Before he risked overthinking what and how to do it, he said, “I don’t think I’ve ever sounded better than when I sang with you.” The moment his lips touched hers, a warmth flowed through his body, his knees threatened to give way and he felt his whole life was a dress rehearsal for this one kiss. 

Being with Rose was like a drug and one day or kiss would never be enough; not when he wanted to take the time to explore her mouth, her mind and her soul. He didn’t want this one kiss to end up being just one kiss.

But, when they broke apart, he suddenly thought of Teasing Georgia, the woman he had only days ago professed was perfect. Tony stood up, apologizing, “I’m sorry, I can’t.”

Even standing, he saw her face crumple. “I understand, I think I should go.” Rose tried to spin her wheelchair around and Tony realised that she had completely misunderstood his reaction.

“No! No, it’s not because of you and it’s not because of the chair.” Oh, help him the truth would be cruel, but she deserved to hear it. “Its nothing like that,” he pleaded.

“Sure,” she said with a bitterness that he deserved.

“I’m sorry, but, there’s someone else”

“Really! Which blonde caught your fancy this time?”

“No, nothing like that – I’m talking about someone I’ve met online. There’s something about the way we talk that is so comfortable. I promise that I’ve loved today, I want to be with you and keep kissing you in places we can’t do in public. But I can’t do that with you when I don’t know how I feel about her anymore.

To his surprise, Rose didn’t seem as devastated as he expected. They stopped walking outside the zoo entrance. She turned and her face seemed peaceful as she asked, “So tell me about this other woman. Have you met her?”

“No, but to be honest, that’s because she doesn’t want to. I keep asking.”

“You’ve fallen for a woman you’ve never met?”

“I know it sounds insane. Her name is Teasing Georgia and we talk online for hours a couple of times a week.”

“About what?”

“Anything and everything. She’s amazing and she gives me so much inspiration.”

“I thought I was your inspiration,” Rose teased, now without bitterness.

“In a different way. I mean, you’re at my gigs and you see me with all my flaws while she only sees the side of me that I show.”

“Does that mean you’re more honest with me than with her?”

“I don’t know,” he said, still confused. “Look Rose, I care about you more …” he started “Look I care about you more than I probably should. You are amazing. You are this most beautiful woman.”

“I’m not beautiful, remember, I’m in a wheelchair.”

Tony thought, wanting to be honest in his reply, “I don’t see that anymore. That night when we had coffee, I stopped seeing the chair and started seeing you as a beautiful, sexy woman.”

“But you can’t kiss me because of a woman you’ve never met.”

When Rose said it like that, he felt like an absolute idiot. This honesty business was impossible. “I can’t lie to you, I can’t lie to her and I don’t know what to do with my feelings for you. I mean, we’ve known each other for ages but this is happening so fast.”

“So where does that leave us, then?” Rose asked.

“She keeps rejecting the idea of us ever meeting in person. I keep asking, but for some reason she keeps saying no.”

“That’s it then – you’re rejecting me for a woman you’ve never met.” Her beautiful face had more patience and understanding than he deserved.

“I’m not rejecting you, Rose but in saying that, I want to be honest; after all, you see me up on stage; you know when I’m being honest up there and when I’m just mouthing the words.”

He knelt at her knees, wanting her to believe him. “I can’t hide myself from you – or lie to you. Whatever happens between us, I’m not going to lie to you with my heart anymore than I’m going to lie to you with my music.”

At least Rose didn’t look away as he held her eyes firm. “Then talk to me. What does this mean for us?” she asked.

“I can’t ignore the connection with the other woman. It could all be a lie, and maybe the only truth is what I’ve got here with you.”

“What if what you’ve got with this other woman is a lie?” Rose asked softly with a sadness that he didn’t understand. Surely, Rose would want the whole thing with Teasing Georgia to be in his imagination?

“I can’t make a decision,” Tony didn’t know how to continue without hurting a woman he was only beginning to understand the depth of his feelings for. “I can’t make a decision on something so huge without at least talking to her.”

Rose didn’t push his hand away as he kissed it, wishing another real kiss could make his confusion disappear, “I’ve never felt the way about another woman as I feel with you, but I need to be honest with everyone.”

“I can’t ask for any more,” Rose kissed each of his finger tips. “Just remember, I’ve loved you longer than you could possibly imagine and no matter what happens with this woman online, I will always love you.”


Teasing Georgia didn’t expect an early evening message from Tony. “_Can we talk?_”

That didn’t sound good. “_Sure,_” she typed.

There was a long pause as the bubbles indicated he was typing but minutes passed before words appeared on the screen. 

“_How do you feel about me?_”

Such few words for such a long time of writing, “_I think you know how I feel._”

“_No, I really don’t. I keep telling you that your perfect to me but you refuse to even meet._”

“_Perhaps, I’m not so perfect,_” she wondered if this was going to be a soft ending to what had been a wonderful relationship.

“_Are you ever going to agree to meet me?_”

“_Why would you want to spoil something you say is perfect?_”

Teasing Georgia had waited months for Tony to give her an ultimatum, wanting him to prove that he was prepared to accept whomever she was. No matter what she looked like, where she lived or how she lived her life. If he couldn’t prove all of that, she was prepared to remain in his life as a confidant – a trusted friend.

“_I think I’m in love with two women._”

Tony’s unexpected words were like a punch to her gut. “_Do I dare ask their names?_”

Seconds seemed like minutes before he replied, “_One of them is you but if you don’t agree to meet with me then it doesn’t matter who the other person is._”

“_Why’s that?_” her fingers took several attempts before hitting the right keys.

“_Because if you care about me as much as I care about you, you would want to see if we can take this into the real world. I’m not going to put my life on hold waiting for you to change your mind._”

That was insulting! “_Tony, you haven’t put your life on hold for me!_” Biting back harsher truths that would give away her secrets, Teasing Georgia typed, “_In your own words, you go out every night, living your life with a thousand women crying for you and begging for you to take them home._”

The bubbles showed he was typing, but she wasn’t finished. “_I’m just the person you talk to when you’re lonely and have no one else._”

“_That’s not true!!!!!_” Tony came back as quickly as her tears fell. “_I talk to you because I like you._”

“_You don’t know anything about me._”

“_Well, who’s fault is that?_”

Teasing Georgia took a breath, wanting to slow down the argument before one of them said something unforgivable. What he said was an inconvenient truth. Ever since he connected with her online, she’d set herself up to be his sounding board – almost a reflection of his good self.

“_Where do you see us going? If we did meet?_” she asked.

“_We could start with coffee? We could work up to you coming to one of my gigs._”

“_How do you know that I haven’t already been to one of your gigs?_” she teased feeling safer with this type of banter.

“_Surely you would have told me – I thought we were honest with each other._”

That hurt, as the truth often did.

“_What if I come to one of your gigs and we can meet up afterwards?_”

A long pause and not even bubbles appeared on the screen to show that he was typing.

“_Please don’t,_” appeared out of the blue.

“_Why not?_” she thought that would be what he wanted.

“_Because if she’s there and you turn up, it would only get uncomfortable for her and I refuse to do anything that could hurt Rose._”

“_So, Rose is the woman you love?_” Each key hit with precision. Her life or at least happiness relied on his answer.

“_Like I said, I think I love you both but I’ve only met one of you._”

“_Have you slept with her?_”

Another pause, what could he be wanting to hide?

“_No, but we shared the most incredible kiss._”

“_So, you want to meet me just to decide which one of us is a better kisser?_”

“_No! Nothing like that._”

More slowly, she typed, “_What if all we have are words on a computer screen?_”

“_I don’t know how much of you and your life is real and how much of it is bullshit! I mean, everything you’ve said could be a lie._”

“_You could be lying to me,_” Teasing Georgia snapped back. Life and love shouldn’t be this complicated.

“_That’s crap and you know it. Anything I’ve told you can be checked out on social media. Just about every gig and every woman I’ve ever had a photo with is online somewhere._”

“_I guess,_” she admitted. “_I don’t know, meeting you would be a big step for me._” An enormous leap of faith and she still didn’t know if he would be up to the challenge.

Just as she was about to log off and deal with Tony another day, another message appeared.

“_Part of me loves you, and another part loves Rose. I’m not trying to be a bastard, but until we meet, how on earth am I supposed to know for sure._”

The screen went blank and she saw he’d logged off. No, “good bye” or “see you around.” Teasing Georgia closed her laptop and curled up in bed. Nothing could distract her; not one of the fifty TV channels, none of her playlists. Not even her other social media accounts filled with funny memes.

Unable to sleep, she opened up her laptop, typing a single line with an address and a time to finally meet the love of her life and face the consequences.


Teasing Georgia had never taken more time with her outfit. He liked tall blondes and she couldn’t pretend to be either. Still, on the off chance that this meeting went well, she selected a golden dress that buttoned from the bodice to the floor. A not-so-subtle nod to the flower from which she had taken her name. Her hair had never been a crowning glory, still she brushed it until it shone and let it fall loosely around her shoulders. A smouldering of eye make up and she couldn’t put off leaving her unit any longer.

Arriving outside the café, she could see Tony already seated at a table at the back of the room with full view of the front door. Unfortunately, the table wasn’t appropriate but he’d figure that out for himself.

“Miss Damask, a pleasure to see you again. Your usual table?” The owner was quicker to greet her than Tony was to react.

“Rose!” he left the table, clearly anxious about his date arriving.

“Tony, glad you could make it, Peter can my friend have another coffee and I’d like …”

“A jug or glass of iced tea?”

“A jug, please – and two slices of your chocolate fudge.”

“Certainly, and our clients are loving the new menus you styled for us.”

“My pleasure, your team were really easy to work with.”

To Tony, she motioned towards her usual table which allowed her wheelchair ready access around the café. “I love the coffee here and Peter makes sure that all the local restaurants use me to design their menus.”

“Rose, I’m sorry, but I’m meeting someone and I don’t want to hurt you. Can you please go somewhere else for your coffee and I promise I’ll explain everything later.”

The poor man was slow to catch on.

“Tony, please join me for coffee so I can do the explaining.”

“What do you have to explain?”

Hell, this was the reason she’d hidden behind her keyboard for months. “Three years ago, I was in a car accident. Drunk driver crossed onto the wrong side of the road. By the time they got me to hospital, I was lucky to keep my legs but there was no feeling below my hips.”

“You’ve never talked about how you got in the chair before, but Rose, this isn’t the time.”

Their coffees arrived and Rose took a moment to enjoy what could be her last minutes with the man she loved. Watching the milk froth around the lips she wanted to kiss, one last time if she could.

“I spent months in hospital and rehab. Most of my friends didn’t know how to deal with the old Rose in a new body. It wasn’t their fault, how were they supposed to know how to react when I didn’t.”

“They should have tried harder,” Tony pulled his chair close enough to stroke her face. “It took me a while, and I’m sorry I didn’t see the woman before I saw the chair.”

“Please, I need to explain. I was alone, lonely and a counsellor suggested I make new friends online, but to be careful and never use my real name or give out details.”

She watched his face for the reaction that had to come. 

“You’re Teasing Georgia?”

“I’m so sorry.”

“I told you that I was in love with two women – and you knew all the time that you were both of them.”

“I didn’t know how to tell you.”

“All this time, you pretended to be someone else, playing me.”

“The only thing I lied about was my name. Yes, I should have told you at some point that I was Rose or she was me, but how do you imagine that conversation starting?”

“I kissed Rose and felt like I was cheating on Teasing Georgia.”

“I’m sorry. I had no idea until then that the online thing was as serious for you as it was for me.”

“I begged you to meet me – why didn’t you just tell me that we were friends in real life?” Tony had pulled away from her, sitting as far back in the chair as he could. Stabbing at the chocolate slice with the small cake fork. Rose didn’t have much time before he stormed out.

“Does it matter when you found out? I needed to know that you loved me for me.”

“There’s a word for what you did – catfish.”

“Yes, but …”

“I can’t even look at you.”

“That just it – for months you knew Rose but only saw the chair. You’d never looked at me as a woman but when I replaced the chair with a keyboard, you opened up.”

“And fell in love with a lie.”

“Never a lie.”

“Believe what you want, tell yourself any bloody excuse you want but every time you had a chance to come clean and didn’t – you lied.”

“No, Tony, please …” Rose cried as he stood.

“You should have trusted me with the truth – especially after our day at the zoo and the kiss.”

“Don’t you see, I couldn’t after the kiss! It meant so much to me and probably more to me than it did to you at the time.”

“You are nothing but a lying, deceitful bitch.”

“No, please Tony, remember the kiss. There was no lying in that kiss.”

“Well hold onto the memories, sweetheart, because it’s never gonna happen again.”

As Tony stormed off, Rose realised it was possible to be too sad for tears. 


This whole mess with Rose or Teasing Georgia or whatever the hell she called herself, was messing with more than his head. He’d felt like shit falling in love with two women, tearing himself inside out with guilt, never suspecting that they were one and the same. The bloody woman played him for a fool and he deserved to be laughed at along with every other mug who’d been catfished. Yes, by now he’d streamed and binge watched series after series of other unsuspecting victims of online scams. 

If only he could stop the memories of their kiss now it was out of the shadow of guilt. The only reason he’d broken it off at the time was out of respect for what he felt for Rose’s online lie. Hours of driving didn’t bring him any closure but he started to calm down and think about how his own actions had contributed. 

If only he’d taken the time to get to know Rose as a person and not just as a fan, he’d never have reached out to a stranger online. 

Days later, Tony decided that they owed it to themselves to try and talk things through now he was over the shock of her deception and willing to listen. He tried to reached Rose through Teasing Georgia’s online accounts, every one of them had been disconnected – deleted – removed. Without her address, phone number or any other way to find her, Tony had to hope that Rose would still turn up to his next gig.

That night, Rose was a no show.

The next night, her place at his fan’s table was taken by a stranger. Yet another bloody blonde who tried and failed to get his attention. Yes, she could move her body around a dance floor, but he didn’t care about that anymore. All he cared about was being with a woman who could spin around in her wheel chair as easily as she could spin around his heart.

Singing his heart out for a woman who didn’t care and had lied to him for months. Tony still couldn’t believe that Rose and Teasing Georgia were the same person – how on earth was he supposed to know that Teasing Georgia was the name of a rose! What man would? Yes, he hadn’t handled the shock well, but the woman had lied to him.

Or had she? Tony racked his brain through each discussion with Teasing Georgia. Had she ever admitting to having been to his concert or did he just assume? For months, it had been all about him and she probably didn’t have a chance to tell him anything about her or her life. He’d been a self-centred bastard and hadn’t given her a chance until it was too late.

Then there was Rose. With a rising guilt, Tony thought back through every conversation which again had usually been about him. Rose had patiently listened and given him confidence to become a better musician – his current passion for the old playlists were because of her. Somehow, and inexplicably, Rose had fallen in love with him before he deserved her and had forced him to see qualities and believe in dreams that he’d given up on years ago. 

Between Teasing Georgia and Rose, he’d rediscovered his passion for music while wanting to be a better person by bringing people together through song. Through her patience and understanding, he’d even been able to see past his own shit and get to know the women, that turned out to be a single woman, in his life.

If he hadn’t been so self-centred, he would have been able to find out the truth earlier, possibly when he deserved to know. Right now, he didn’t deserve either of them.

He’d been late to the gig trying to track her down. Unwilling to give up, Tony had tried any combination of names that Rose could have created an account under. Any new likes or follows on his social media account only lead to dead ends. For months he’d known where to find Rose but had never taken the time to really get to know her. Reaching another frustrating dead end, he vowed to make all the time in the world, if only she would reappear.

Hours of looking for her instead of sleeping, eating or even practicing the new numbers he had planned to launch on the crowd tonight. He should have tried harder to get to the gig on time, perhaps her friends knew how to get in touch. Or at least tell him that she was alright. 

For the rest of his life, he’d own all the names: conceited, egotistical, self-centred. He’d even try and change if the woman beside was named Rose.

Tony’s prayers went unanswered as Rose remained missing. The entire first set was as flat as he’d ever played with none of the crowd favourites. He’d held off on any song Rose loved just in case she was running late.  even though he knew that his reaction had probably broken her heart in ways that he didn’t know how to come back from.

“Gonna play anything decent in the next set?” 

“You okay, mate?”

“What was with the new songs?”

Tony had dropped by Rose’s usual table in between sets for news about Rose, not a critique on the worst gig of his career. 

“Just a bit off tonight, how about I buy a round of drinks to make up for it.”

He counted down the minutes until a break in conversation allowed him to ask the all-important question, “Where was the girl in the wheel chair tonight?”

“Who knows. Maybe she knew you were going to play like crap,” one of the guys laughed at his own joke.

“Seriously, she’s always sitting up front. Shouldn’t one of you check on her?” Tony tried to hide his growing panic. What if he never saw her again?

“And say what? Ask for a doctor’s note for not coming out? Mate, chill.”

No matter how subtly or plainly he asked, none of the regulars could help. it was as if she had dropped off the face of the earth and he was the only one who noticed or cared.

The whole bloody night, each song seemed strangled. Not one chord came naturally and he almost lost control when tradition demanded a set of love songs. Towards the end of the night when those in the crowd who’d paired up needed a romantic push towards finishing off all the flirting in bed. Looking out to where Rose’s chair should have been, Tony channelled her kiss as he sang a selection of heartbreaking love song; each one more poignant the other but still none of them had the words he wanted to say. Tony never thought that playing to a memory could be more emotional than playing to a person, but tonight was the night for heartbreak and he left everything on stage.


Just after midnight, Tony logged-on and sent Teasing Georgia a message – tagging her name in every type of social media and asking his fans and friends to reach out and find her. Yes, she’d lied to him but he hadn’t been an innocent. At the very least, they deserved to start again as friends, rebuild trust and give him a chance to get to know the real Rose. Nothing. Not even when he repeated his request an hour later.  

Tony stayed glued to his computer all night, unable to take his eyes of the screen and too anxious to sleep in case that was the moment she decided to reach out. 

By morning and exhausted from a night with no sleep and tormented by his own feelings of inadequacy Tony did something he hadn’t done in years. His old acoustic guitar had been relegated to the back of his wardrobe. Pushing aside boxes and crates, Tony pulled out the battered case and reacquainted himself with the guitar chords. Luckily, his secret tuning techniques all came back and Tony smiled as he remembered the last time he’d thrown the guitar in the case, vowing never to play it again. 

Barely out of his twenties, Tony spent less than twenty minutes in the office of a pumped-up agent, full of his own self importance just because a career could be made or broken depending on his mood of the day. Within the blink of an eyelid, the “music expert” bluntly assured Tony that he didn’t have what it took to be a rock-star. Not only that, he was too ugly to market and would only ever make a living playing on cruise ships and pandering to middle-aged women. 

“Do you want to hear another song?” Tony had begged. All of his industry connections had been used to get this meeting. He needed it to work.

“Unnecessary. Look, I can see you are classically trained. Until you’re ready for the cruise ships, how about you go back and embrace the classics because you don’t have the look or the talent to become a star.”

“But …”

“I tried to be kind, but here it is. I can hear the classical training in your voice and playing. Yeah, some people can cross over but you aren’t that talented. You’ll only ever be a classical musician trying to pretend to be a rock-star.”

That was the day Tony stopped writing music. The guitar came close to being sold to pay the rent or electricity bills, but somehow a gig always came up with enough money to see him through. Now, it lived in the back of his wardrobe, a constant reminder of what he once was and how wrong the guy had been. Tony might not have made his fortune as a musician, but it was his sole living and had put a roof over his head. 

Even after all these years, the fretboard felt comfortable under his fingers. The chords in his head made their way to his hands until his idea started to take shape. Back in the day, he used to write songs on the guitar and the peace of creating magic came flooding back. Tony kept changing up the chords until he got a melody down pat. The words had haunted him day and night since he lost contact with Rose, but still the pain of seeing them on paper was almost too much. More than once, he threw the crumpled words across the room. Only to bring it back to the table and keep working. Crossing through words, changing them around until they worked with his new song. At one point, he wanted to play it safer and changed the chorus only to remember this would be a song for Rose. Hopefully, one day, she’d watch him play and realise that they deserved to give each other a second chance. Tony fought through fatigue and emotion until he’d finished writing the lyrics and music in one sitting.


After all these years Tony had hundreds of connections in and around the music industry. The question he was now desperate to ask was whether anyone would give him one chance – one last chance. He’d checked with the bank and using a redraw facility on his home loan, he could scrap together enough to produce this one song. A song for Rose.

Handing over his next week of gigs to mates who agreed to drop in and lend a hand, Tony cancelled anything that could distract him from the song. After forcing himself to grab a couple of hours sleep, he hit the phone, reintroducing himself to old friends and former band members as he called in old favours and offered up new ones. The only food was home delivered and the only time he ate was mouthfuls while listening to the early tracks. If he was going to do this professionally, he needed as clean a product as possible. 

But after he’d laid down the keyboard track, Tony realized the rawness of a home studio gave the song a much-needed honesty. At home, he could look over to the laptop that once held Rose’s secrets. Inspired, his fingers glided over the keys, as if Rose was telling him how to play.

Gradually and without warning, old friends started dropping by eager to hear this new song.

“Mate, she must be something if she got you writing again!” Seemed to be the common opening before each one of them had some sort of suggestion from mixing to other tracks. 

Tony accepted most suggestions and at one point, sat back as his baby took shape without him. 

“Who do you want on guitar?” Spider asked fondling his own electric beast. 

“I want to try my old acoustic. Get that haunting and stripped back feeling.”

No one agreed with his idea, not even when he was playing. But when the tracks were put together, the song had the raw emotion Tony needed. All it needed was the vocals and he had the right group of friends on hand to do the backings.

As they all set up and agreed the roles, Tony counted fifteen friends who were musicians. Since he was the common denominator, each of then bonded over stories of his mishaps and the times he’d put himself last to help out a friend. From driving six hours to rescue band equipment from a broken down van, to filling in for missing band members without notice and pay, to being a sounding board when some of them didn’t know which way to jump in their careers.

Hearing all the stories, Tony realized he might have been a selfish bastard with Rose and Teasing Georgia, but his friends here were testament to him deserving a second chance.

“Just stay honest with the song. Don’t give into temptation and overthink it,” Crix, one of his oldest mentors and new drummer with Stormy Waters suggested. Tony still couldn’t believe that one of Australia’s leading rock bands were in town during his moment of need, and that Crix heard about his song, turning up unannounced. He’d heard all the music tracks and at least said he was impressed.

“Thanks, but I don’t know that it’s enough.”

“Play it again.”

Crix listened to the song a couple more times before pronouncing his verdict. “Mate, I think we need to release two versions. An acoustic, stripped down version that is just your voice calling out to the woman you love which will also be the last song you play at each concert, and the second version has all the bells and whistles that will go crazy on the playlists.” 

“But I haven’t released anything commercially in years.” 

“Consider this your fresh start. I’d say in this room we are the Australian music industry version of internet influencers,” Crix looked around the room to nodding faces. “We’ll put it up online and start sharing the hell out of it. I’d say within twelve hours, it will get picked up and we’ll have you on every radio station talking about the mysterious Rose. If we get it out there with the right buzz, I guarantee she’ll hear about it and you’ll make a sweet fortune even if she doesn’t come back to you.”

“I don’t give a rats ass about the money. I just want her to hear the song and understand that it comes from my heart.” Tony shrugged.

“And that’s the difference between you today and the Tony from years ago. The arsehole I used to know only wanted fame and money. It was obvious every time you strapped on the guitar or sat down to write a song. You didn’t give a damn about selling love or an emotion, only trying to make it commercially successful.”

“Thanks, I didn’t realise you thought I was such a dick,” Tony started as the room laughed with him.

“We’re all dicks, it goes with being a narcissistic musician. But that song you’ve just written – that my friend is what separates you from the pack as both an artist and a musician.”

Tony worked the lyrics, doing take after take until even his harshest critic was satisfied. 

“That’s all folks,” Crix opened up a beer to celebrate the final take. “Now, how the hell are we going to get this song in front of your woman?”

“I have no idea mate,” Tony started thinking through all the possible scenarios. “If she’s not going to come to my gigs then how will I ever know if she’s heard it?”

Then, he made a decision that might not make him popular with his friends or fans, but hopefully it would bring Rose to him. “I’m never going to play this song live until she’s in the audience.”

“That’s a mistake. Once the song gets momentum, people will be coming to your concerts to hear this song,” Crix warned. “I promise you it’s that good.”

“I don’t care. I’m never going to play this live until she’s in the audience she will have to come just to stop the questions. If the song is that good, someone will reach out and get her to one.”

“They’ll hate you if you don’t play it.”

“They can’t hate me more than she does right now.” Now that the song was finished, there was nothing for Tony to do other than go back to his empty life. Yes, his friends assured him that the song was good and they’d promote it, but then what? What if the song became like his musician dreams – fantastic in theory but over before they began.

“Tone, I promise you,” Crix said. “If she hears that song it won’t be hate that she’s feeling.”


It only took two weeks of smothering all the commercial stations, podcasts and social media with his song before Tony turned up to his normal gig. Standing room only with the crowd wanting to hear his original songs and not only the covers. He figured that the first one that met with muted response would be the trigger to pulling out his regular set. Yet song after song triggered the reaction he only dreamed of ten years ago.

“Song for Rose.”

“Song for Rose.”

“Song for Rose.”

The chant in between songs never ceased. His first fans and now friends could only shrug.

“I’m sorry,” he started the last set with the same monologue from the past nights. “I wrote the song for one woman and until I can watch her eyes when I play it the first time, I’m sorry but you’ll have to stream it on the way home.”

“And after I made such an effort to get here!” Tony barely heard her voice through the crowd.

“Rose?” he called. “Rose?”

The crowd parted for the wheelchair. Her puffy eyes couldn’t hide the tears and lack of sleep any more than his own. In one movement, he jumped down from the stage and hugged this woman who had turned his life upside down. Wanting to smother her face in kisses, but hopefully they would have a lifetime for those.

“I’ve waited for you.”

“I know, just about every person I know has asked if I’m your Rose.”

“What do you tell them?”

“That I used to be your Rose, but I screwed it up.”

“Haven’t you heard the song?” he waited until she nodded. “I’m the one who blew it. If I hadn’t been such a self-centred prick, I would have only known Rose.”

“I should have told you the truth earlier.”

“Let me guess,” he smiled for the first time in weeks. “You were afraid how I’d take it?”

“Something like that – are you going to play me the song or not?”

“That depends, if you’ve heard the song then I assume you know the backing vocals. It wouldn’t be a song for Rose without you.”

Tony waited until Rose nodded and then gently lifted her from the chair. Cradling her in his arms, while one of their friends put two chairs on the stage. He wouldn’t be standing over her, not when he needed her to see his eyes.

“Ladies and gentlemen, I suggest you get your phones out because this is the world first, live performance of A Song for Rose. If you’ll bear with me, I’ll swap the piano for my old guitar.

“Ready?” he asked Rose, handing her a microphone. “By the way, I wrote this for you.”

“So I heard,” Rose blew him a kiss as he strummed the introduction.


**A song for rose** 

_I never expected to meet someone, who would accept me as I am_<br>
accepting you and loving me

_Never thought I was worth that much, until through your eyes I am_<br>
more worthy than you’ll know

_Never used to laugh aloud, at the funny things in life_<br>
never knew, never loved, never laughed, never fun

_Never loved and never lost in my empty, lonely life_<br>
lonely without you, lost without you

_My flaws are open to you, my heart and truth so bare_<br>
heart and truth laid bare

_I’m just a man whose made mistakes, humbly asking you to care_<br>
heart and truth laid bare

_One more chance, I’m begging. My heart and truth are yours_<br>
heart and truth are yours

_Won’t you accept my love tonight and forever more?_<br>
<br>

“What will it take for us to forgive each other and start over?” Tony held her close, feeling her heart beat in time with his own. 

“Kiss me like you mean it.”

So, he did.
