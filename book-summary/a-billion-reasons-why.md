## Can Ellin forgive Mason the billionaire when she fell in love with 'Ryan' the lie?

**Ellin never believed in the good of others or in love at first sight until a stranger called 'Ryan' turned up at her door.**

After Mason Winters collected a billion dollars by listing his company, his world is turned upside down after being pushed aside by the new corporate owners. Needing to escape the city and women who only want his money, **Mason becomes 'Ryan'** and travels half way across the country on a whim. Never expecting to fall in love.

Ellin's **love for family** is stronger than her pride. Nervously, she introduced the world to the Australian outback with a single plea for help, never expecting to fall in love with the **stranger at her door**.

Under a billion stars she let down her defences and trusted his love. A million times he could have told her the **truth**.

Can Ellin remember she **fell in love with the man**, regardless of his name? Or was their whole love story a lie?


If you loved the emotion of **Trusting his Heart**, want your billionairs to have a heart and for the good girl to get what she deserves, you need answers to **A Billion Reasons Why** today.
