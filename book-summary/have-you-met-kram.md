Some characters deserve more than a cameo role. Early this year, I asked my readers to tell me what they wanted for Alex MacFarlane from [The Uni Student](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076NRVM5M/ "The Uni Student"). The response to [Have You Met ... Alex]({{ site.baseurl }}/book-summary/have-you-met-alex.html "Have You Met ... Alex") started a new series. 

Now there is [Have You Met ... Scout]({{ site.baseurl }}/book-summary/have-you-met-scout.html "Have You Met ... Scout") about one of my sexy military men; [Have You Met ... Chris]({{ site.baseurl }}/book-summary/have-you-met-chris.html "Have You Met ... Chris"); [Have You Met ... Tony]({{ site.baseurl }}/book-summary/have-you-met-tony.html "Have You Met ... Tony"); [Have You Met ... Robert]({{ site.baseurl }}/book-summary/have-you-met-robert.html "Have You Met ... Robert"); and [Have You Met ... Dr Hunter]({{ site.baseurl }}/book-summary/have-you-met-drhunter.html "Have You Met ... Dr Hunter").

Earlier this month, I released my latest military suspense romance, [Defend Her](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TSTD7N3/ "Defend Her"). I fell in love with Jax, Vinn, Spider and Sphinx. But it was ex-commando Kram who demanded a happily ever after of his own. Enjoy, **Have you met ... Kram**.

## Have you met ... Kram?

**He never expected to rescue a mother and her baby. He never expected to fall in love**


_Why did computers always take so long to boot up?_ Kram pulled his usual face at his first sip of green juice, impatiently waiting for the rotating circle to do its job and log him into his secure email. That initial hit of kale, cucumber and lemon woke him in a way coffee never could; shame he’d never gotten used to the awful taste. Still, his body was his temple and the longer he kept in shape the longer he’d stay alive.

_Message from PX783_

Now this was a message he couldn’t wait to open, Kram flexed his knuckles, stretched his head sideways and rotated his shoulders almost as if readying himself for battle. Nothing felt as exhilarating as the possibility of a new job and Proxy always had something interesting on the boil. At his price point and with his experience, Kram’s contacts didn’t bore him with mundane jobs or with weekly offers. The ones that came his way were the worst of the worst. There was no judgement, just an acceptance that former Australian commando “Kram” never answered to his legal name of Mark Novak, and he’d go places and do things that gave other commandos nightmares. Still, he charged more for his effort which left him more time to lead a simple life; surfing, drumming.

_Target: Female 23. Photo attached._

Seriously? He might be bloody good at his job, but he needed more than a photo. No name, no address, no nothing, just a photo. His secure phone started buzzing and Kram had to laugh at the timing.

“So, are you going to give me anything more than a photo — seriously, I get more than that on a dating app.”

“If a guy like you needs dating apps, there’s no hope for the rest of us.” Proxy hid the biggest heart behind an ugly face. Nothing like being pulled out of a burning jeep in Afghanistan to dent his dating prospects.

“Mate, call it window shopping and in any case, half an hour reading fake profiles reminds me that I’m better off single.”

“You’re gonna have to settle down some time.”

He didn’t have time for this, he could hear the breaking waves a couple of streets away from his home at Rainbow Beach in Port Macquarie. Money or surf, Proxy needed to get to the point. “Have you got a job for me or not?”

“Heard you were involved in rescuing the Colonel’s daughter a while back.”

“You know that if it did happen, I can’t comment.”

“Whatever; keep your secrets. Similar situation. This time it’s a guy who has lost his wife.”

“And?” Proxy wouldn’t have called him about a missing spouse. Hundreds of other guys could find a missing dame in their sleep. 

“I don’t know what the deal is, he was sketchy on the details. All he said was that whoever she is with, needs to be returned.”

“Returned? What about the wife? What happens to her?”

“Like I said, it’s sketchy I’ve got more deets, but I can only give them to you if you agree to take the job and sign the paperwork involved.”

“I don’t do paperwork.”

“Apparently, that’s not negotiable. He wants you to sign some nondisclosures and some other stuff I haven’t seen the final draft.”

“Then, I’m not your guy. I don’t do paperwork and I want full information before I agree to anything. Including what he wants returned.”

At least the surf looked as good as it sounded. With school back and the weekday workers putting in salaried hours, he could sit back and wait for the perfect break and not share. Still, not even a full day out on his board could make him forget the photo and conversation. Too many things didn’t add up.

What did it say about him that he’d printed off the photo on his way out the door so it would greet him from the dashboard? Carefully drying off his hands before he picked it up, trying to find the answers. Who was the woman, what’s her story and why would her husband be willing to let paperwork get between finding his wife?

His fascination with her had to be down to her eyes. Just as well he didn’t get involved; if her photo turned up on a dating app he wouldn’t hesitate before swiping right.

Shoulder length, dark curly hair not too curly just wavy with violet eyes and the most porcelain skin he’d ever seen. Man, she looked exactly like that old actress, who was it again — Elizabeth Taylor — that’s right. His mother loved old movies and he had never wanted to admit that mother-son time was actually son crushing on an actress from another era.

The woman in the photo could star in his real-life movie any time she wanted. Luckily, he’d already passed on the job.


Two days later, the woman’s photo had started to fade in the hot Australian sun and Kram had settled on Bali for his next surfing holiday when his secure phone interrupted his planning.

“Proxy, man long time no hear.” Two days was a new record when he wasn’t on the job. Proxy’s usual clients weren’t the same as Kram’s. 

“Let’s go for coffee same place.”

“Tomorrow?”

“Pack for an overnight stay.”

“I already said ‘no’.” Although he wondered if the woman would look the same in person. 

“This time you’ll say ‘yes’.”

For everyone’s safety and privacy, Kram had a set routine for each of his contacts. A different coffee shop for each contact who would arrive at 10am and would either find or wait for a table in the back. Kram generally arrived half an hour late after making sure the place was secure. Overnight meant come ready to start working immediately. But Proxy knew he just said ‘no’.

Old habits died hard, and Kram got his “work vehicle” out of storage. From the outside, an old, faded white, rusty Ford Falcon. Only a knowing eye would see the rust was superficial, the engine hot and suspension top grade. Not even passengers could tell the sides had armor plates or notice the front and back windscreen frames were actually disguised roll bars. A couple of changes of clothes, a week’s supply of food rations and water, freshly cleaned handguns and his family of knives. 

Patting farewell to his surfboard, Kram set off for just another “coffee.”


“Mate, good to see you.” Proxy got up to greet him as the two coffees arrived. Kram had to respect a guy who could predict his needs. “Private security seems to be treating you well.”

“Can’t complain,” Kram grinned. “Money’s good, the hours are sweet and I’ve never surfed so much in my life.”

“Still got that heavy metal cover band on the side?”

“Best cover of all,” Kram tapped out a beat on the table. “I can walk into any pub in Australia, do a couple of jam sessions with musos and suddenly I’ve got a reason to stick around and do my real job.”

“And no one suspects what else the drummer can do with his hands!” Proxy had the grace to laugh but from the fierce look, Kram knew he was still being interviewed. Yes, he’d done a couple of jobs for the guy, but neither of them had spilt blood for each other. Trust that came with dollar bills could only take him so far. He preferred dealing with soldiers he’d caught fire with. Still, an interview of sorts could pay for a belated trip to Bali.

“You didn’t invite me to coffee to talk about my hands or band. What’s this about?”

“Your good friend, Vinn gave me a call yesterday about that girl I told you about.”

“Mate, I ready said no.” A wasted day sorting out the car, still he’d shaved eight minutes off his personal best.

“Yeah, I heard you. This one is off the books, and with no reward. Give me five minutes. What I’m about to tell you, Vinn can back it up before you make your decision.”

“Shoot.” Kram knew his tapping fingers were annoying as hell, but too bad. This was a waste of time.

“Vinn signed all the paperwork you wouldn’t look at. He then got the details and checked into the client and the woman some more.”

“So?”

“The woman is in hiding from her husband and from what Vinn found out, he handed back the job. He can’t do anything to help the woman, but that doesn’t mean you can’t.”

“Why would I want to.”

Proxy stabbed the table with a bread knife, millimetres from Kram’s tapping. Point made. “Because apparently the scumbag husband considers the wife a possession and when she left him, he sees it as a possession that has been stolen. But he doesn’t want her back as his wife.”

“What do you mean?”

“He wants her back and he is going to punish her. Apparently, when Vinn sat him down for a couple of beers, the guy was most forthcoming on what happens to women who try to run away.”

“So, what’s that got to do with me. Knowing more doesn’t mean I’m interested.”

“Not to do the job, you moron. With Vinn pulling out, that means the client is looking for someone with less morals.”

“And you came back to me.” Kram retracted the knife and slowly handed it back. “I wouldn’t try that again unless you mean to use it.” 

Shaking his head, Proxy insisted, “It got your attention. Mate, I know you. Your home ground advantage might be doing the squeamish, but I’ve never doubted your morals no one ever has. Here’s a woman who is going to die at the hands of her ex-husband if you don’t find her first.”

Proxy passed over the manila folder to Kram. Bank statements, phone records the guy had been stalking his wife for years and then nothing. Smart girl, she knew how to pull out just enough cash without triggering any warnings and had obviously ditched her phone.”

“Social media accounts? Emails. How do I get them if the husband isn’t helping me?”

“That’s why they usually pay you the big bucks.”

“But not this time.”

“Nah, and you can’t use Sphinx because he’s signed up with Vinn’s firm.”

“No probs I’ve got my own guy I can trust.” His tech guy, Spider worked with Sphinx on the Colonel’s daughter case and there would be an element of professional support. Same with Vinn who owed him a beer or two. Time to collect.

“So you’ll do it.” Proxy decided rather than asking, handing him an enlarged copy of the photo he’d already seen, printed and maybe fantasized about.

“Do I really have a choice? Look at her. Too gorgeous and too young to be in a body bag.

Proxy passed over a passport sized photo of the ex-husband.

Ugly fucking dude with inherited entitlement all over his smug face, “Can’t say the same about the guy.”



Laurel Moreno held her crying daughter in the cheap motel room as the sun started its daily ascent. Trapped by needing to make the last of her money stretch as long as possible, and the greed of motel managers charging double for not having identification. Their safety depended on her not leaving a paper or money trail, and not staying in the same place for longer than one week.

Her heart stopped with the unexpected knock at the door, only restarting with the familiar voice, “Miss?”

“Yes, coming.” Laurel checked herself in the cracked mirror. Her dark hair hadn’t been washed with shampoo in weeks. Far cheaper to rinse daily, let it dry naturally and assume the natural oils would make for healthier hair. These days, her money was spent on motels, food, nappies and formula. Her definition of necessities had contracted as the weeks went by and her cash grew smaller. Hell, in less than a week her toothpaste would be gone, but at least she could probably buy a box of bicarb soda that will keep going for a year. Things she never thought about before now were all-consuming. She couldn’t even apply to the government for assistance — knowing her ex-husband, he had contacts everywhere and as soon as they found her address, it would all be over.

“Can I help you?” she asked hoping that the day manager’s face hadn’t given away her next predicament.

“We’ve had complaints about the noise.

“She’s only a baby and is teething.”

“I understand that, but we have to respond to the complaints. I can give you a late check out, but you have to leave, today.”

“Where am I supposed to go?” Before much longer, she’d have to waste what little money she had on a train out of town. Hopefully, accommodation would be cheaper in the country, but at the risk of staying anonymous.

“I don’t know, but if you are trying to keep a low profile then this isn’t the way to do it.”

“How do you know that I’m trying to keep a low profile?” Oh, no. Had she been too obvious? She’d never keep her daughter alive by making stupid decisions.

“Honey, you’re not the first woman I’ve had here who’s running away from something or someone.” With an unnecessary glance around to make sure no one cared enough to watch them, the woman handed over a crumpled slip of paper from her pocket. “I wouldn’t normally hand this out, but if you go to this address, you might get the help you need. Take care, right?”

“Can I at least get her to sleep?” Her daughter took at least one night to settle into anywhere new, and if they were about to move again, Laurel wanted to give Jasmine as much time to sleep as possible.

“The owner agreed to a late checkout, but if you want to get to this place, there’s only two trains each day and the next one leaves in an hour.”

Laurel turned to her daughter who had fallen asleep, her cheeks puffy and red. This had to end somehow. She needed to find somewhere that they could stop running but friends of friends had already left messages online. Her ex-husband had gone nuclear in trying to track her down. He no longer worried who heard his jokes about what he had planned for her. Maybe in the early days, she could have gone back and pleaded for his forgiveness and mercy. But after almost three months on the run, to give up now meant her certain death and Jasmine trapped in her father’s prison forever.


Luckily, Jasmine’s cries from the train ride stopped as the taxi hit every bump and pothole on the drive through two small country towns and past deserted farms. 

Watching the driver through the rearview mirror, Laurel hoped her luck would continue, not having much of a choice. She needed to trust that the taxi driver respected her cash incentive to turn off his meter, take her to the address and forget she existed. The train had gotten her within 20 kilometres from the address, dropping her at a town with enough small shops and no security cameras that she felt comfortable in stocking up on groceries. Jasmine’s pram filled with bags, her daughter fell asleep in her joey pouch, heartbeat against heartbeat. The first two taxi drivers weren’t interested, but the third took agreed to a fixed price ride. Other than small talk about the impact on drought and local workers on the dying country towns, the driver allowed her to relax and enjoy her silent thoughts.

Having no way back to town, all her trust had been placed in a piece of paper. That’s what her life had come to; trusting in strangers.

No.

Trusting her instincts in picking strangers.

So far, she’d chosen wisely, and Jasmine seemed happy enough. Maybe in a small town, she could get a job that paid cash or even provided board. Australian country folk were known for helping out someone down on their luck, and right now, she fit the bill.

The sight of the small farmhouse dented her confidence. Miles off the main road, surrounded by dusty fields, the weatherboard building had seen better days. 

“Are you sure this is the place, Miss?”

“I’m sure,” she said, praying it didn’t turn out to be a trap. Within seconds of her bags being removed from the car, they were already covered in a thin film of dust, worsened when the car turned and sped off back to civilization.

A small, grey-haired woman met her on the verandah, reaching out to help her with almost translucent skin but eyes twinkling with life. “Here, love, let me help you with those.”

With a touch of homesickness, Laurel might have been welcomed into her grandmother’s home rather than that of a stranger.

“Hi, the manager at Vacation Inn suggested my daughter and I could get a bed for a few nights?”

“Come in, come in. Bless you both, I’ve been waiting for you.”

With practiced hands, the woman took Laurel’s sleeping daughter from the pram and put her in a makeshift cot close to the warmth of the kitchen. For once, her daughter didn’t stir when being moved and Laurel could have cried with gratitude. Clutching her only possessions close, she didn’t know where to look or sit.

“I need a room for my daughter and I.” In case she hadn’t been clear the first time.

“Of course, my dear girl, but let’s get a bowl of fresh soup into you first. I keep a pot on the stove.”

“You mean, I’m not the only one here?” There hadn’t been other cars out the front, only an old ute under an even older carport.

“Oh, you are. The moment I heard you were on your way, I put on a pot of soup and let my contacts know that I’m full. No one will know that you are here. No one will disturb you.”

The huge bowl held three ladles of the thick soup, with so many vegetables it could have been a casserole. Only after she was half-way through her second bowl, Laurel realized it had been weeks since she’d eaten her fill. Or real food.



“Here’s an address you should check out,” Spider said before sending him the text. “Apparently there is a woman who provides refuge to women on the run. Four days ago, she put up the ‘full’ sign.”

“In English?” Kram preferred his details straight to the point. Stuck in a cheap, Sydney motel room for three days tracking down the missing wife, he loved Spider as a brother in arms, but they’d both started getting on each others’ nerves.

“We know that Laurel Moreno left the Vacation Inn four days ago. We are pretty sure she caught the train from Central Station in Sydney out to Junee.”

“Based on the CCTV footage your friend borrowed.”

“Whatever, I didn’t ask how, only about timings. We know what time she left the motel and we know that a cab dropped her off at the train station.”

“Pushing a pram.”

“Smart girl, she can hide her suitcase in a pram and no one looks twice at a woman pushing one.”

“Anyway, a taxi driver went off the grid for three hours after picking up a fair at Junee Station. Other drivers were talking about it at the pub and he wasn’t answering any of their questions.”

“And a round trip out to this address is?”

“About three hours.”

“How fast can we get to Junee?”

“Hold on, you’re on your own now. I’m tech support not field craft!” Spider shut down his laptop. “I’ll check us out of here, but you better hit the road in that dust heap you call a car. I reckon a mere mortal would take five hours with traffic.”

“I’ll make it in four.”

“It’s been a pleasure doing business with you again, but Kram.” Suddenly, Spider dropped the banter, “If I found her this quickly, others will be able to pick up the trail.”

“Like I said, I’ll make it in four.”


Four hours and twenty minutes later, Kram turned onto a dirt road leading up to where his GPS assured him was the correct address. No time for niceties, he grabbed his bag and bashed on the door. “Laurel, Laurel Moreno.”

At the sound of a baby crying, he forced the door open, hell a kindergarten kid could have kicked it open. Following the cry, he found the dishevelled woman nursing the baby hiding behind a shower curtain.

“My name is Kram, I don’t know how to explain who I am or how I found you, only that your ex-husband has employed people just as good as me, and if you don’t trust me, they’ll be here and won’t be making introductions.”

“How did you find me?” Still she didn’t move and Kram tried to amend his calculations to include a baby. Why didn’t anyone tell him?

“Your ex wants whoever you are with returned to him. I assume this is his child?”

“Yes, but you’ll take her over my dead body. She can’t go back and be raised by him. He hit hurt once, and I’ll never let him hit her again.”

Whether she was telling the truth or not, the fear couldn’t be faked. “Look, I didn’t know about the kid, but we don’t have a lot of time. Get your stuff together and let’s get you somewhere safe.”

“How do I know I can trust you?”

Kram heard the sound of two cars coming up the dirt road. He didn’t have to look to know that they were European and not built for country driving. Shit. “Who else lives here?”

“Mary, but she went into town to visit her sister.”

Unpacking his bag, Kram checked his handguns and grabbed the oilskin with his knives. “Stay here, both of you lie down in the tub until I get back. Even if you hear others come into the house, stay quiet. Give the kid a dummy or your tit, whatever it takes. Got it?”

“Yes.”


It happened so fast; Laurel didn’t have time to react. Multiple voices were yelling outside for “the bitch” to come out. Three short gunshots and she assumed by the reaction that two had hit the target, but others remained.

To stay or go? Laurel hated the idea of waiting to be killed. She could either try and help her new friend, or at least lead the others away from her daughter. There were so many out-houses on the property, she could get them to chase her to one of those. Buy some time, hopefully Kram would save her daughter.

“I love you, princess Jasmine, I love you to infinity and beyond,” she kissed Jazy, resettled her with a dummy and left the bathroom. The only weapons she could think of were a fire iron and kitchen knives. Through the kitchen window, she saw the Kram guy dodge between cars before taking a single shot. A thud and she assumed he found his mark. Where had he come from — how did he know — and why was he helping her? Surely, her ex would pay him double?

Keeping her head down, she worked her way to the back door where she had full view of Kram stalking two intruders, but when she saw a third get into position to take a shot, she screamed and threw one of the knives. Not expecting to hit the guy, but at least it gave Kram time to spin, shoot. Not before she saw Kram flung back, hit in the chest.

“No!” she screamed again.

“I’ll get the girl!” One of the intruders ran at her, and she sprinted off the veranda, away from the house and Jasmine. He caught her close to the old well that Mary swore still held the purest water. “How about you and I have a little fun before I return you to your husband. He won’t mind if his property is a little damaged!”

She struggled to hold onto the fire poker, but with his focus on that, when she let go and stabbed the small knife into his cheek and then neck, he whimpered like a dog before the gurgling blood pulsed out. Pushing him away, she ran back towards the house where Kram was lying unconscious in the dirt, next to the last intruder. Quickly searching Kram’s pockets, she found the key to his car. With no time to waste, she ran inside, grabbing Jasmine and her pram. Only when her daughter was safe in the car and the intruders hadn’t moved, Laurel half dragged Kram to his car. “Come on, I can’t do this by myself. You have to help.” Groggy, he at least heaved himself into the passenger seat and Laurel took a chance to go back for his bag, knives, the three handguns in the dirt and then Jazy’s nappy bag.”

Not knowing where to go, she turned left out of the driveway, and found the Olympic Highway. The next T-intersection, she turned right, wondering if she should drop Kram off at a hospital. 

No. Too many questions, cameras and what would she say? That she’d run away from an abusive husband who’d paid some goons to track her down and kill her? Yeah, that would be believed.

She needed to get off the main highway, and the sign to Coolamon seemed to call her — if only because of the line in a song. No, that was a Coolabah Tree, not Coolamon. By the time she’d corrected herself, she was already driving towards the town. The further she drove the more sparse the landscape, and buildings. Where the taxi driver would have seen signs of drought, she saw opportunity. All they needed was a deserted barn, off the road where she could make sure Jazy was dry and fed, and Kram didn’t die from blood seeping out of his right shoulder, luckily not his chest. Hopefully, if she could get some medical supplies the worse thing to happen would be a stain on his car seat.

Coolamon was a lot bigger than she expected. Taking a risk, she took Jasmine and the pram into the closest supermarket as the staff were still gossiping about the night before while setting up. No one noticed the woman with a baby stuffing bandages and antiseptic underneath the blanket. Not when they could judge her for a bottle of vodka, nappies and formula. 

“What a cute little boy!”

“I know, he looks just like his father, luckily he doesn’t snore like him!” She slurred her words. “Look, my unemployment check hasn’t come through yet, think you can spot me a packet of smokes?” Not that she smoked, but she wanted the staff to remember the vodka, baby boy and cigarettes, not what she looked like.

“No, sorry.” The young girl looked around, “But here, take one of these sterilizing kits for the baby bottles. The sales chick said they are strong enough to use in hospitals!”

Laurel chose to think it was a sign her prayers could be answered and not that karma would punish her for the stolen items in the pram.

Another twenty kilometres out of town and with the sign to Ganmain drawing near, Laurel took a chance on a gate that had grass growing over it with a long dirt track leading up to a building. No other structures seemed nearby and it was a good a place as any to pull in. With Kram groaning in his sleep, she knew that his shoulder needed cleaning and compression applied, otherwise a hospital wouldn’t be optional.

It took some time to release the gate from the long grass, but once she did, the track to the unlocked barn was easy. Long deserted from the state of the dust and rusty old tractor, there was still enough room to back the car in and close the doors. Privacy, security and hopefully time to recover.



Kram awoke to a throbbing pain in his right shoulder and a dull ache to the back of his head. Alive, and from the sound of a baby’s cry, they’d all made it out in one piece. He could hardly remember anything since meeting Laurel in the bathroom. Snippets of gun fire, her scream saving his life and then a hand-to-hand fight that probably cost him a knife.

“Whoa, don’t move.” He hadn’t noticed her firm pressure to the shoulder. “It’s taken over an hour to get the bleeding to stop.”

“Mmmmmm,” he bit down on the pain. Damn it! Shot again. If he didn’t get the fucking bullet out, it wouldn’t be just his life on the line, but Laurel and her baby.

Fuck! What asshole sends a bunch of mercenaries to hunt down a woman and baby. Any single soldier worth a pay packet should be able to take them out with two shots. Six guys was over-kill, but not enough to have stopped Kram from protecting the woman who didn’t even start trusting him until the goons crashed the party.

What the hell was he supposed to do. Bullet and infection first, get Laurel to safety and then he could get some “friends” together and go hunting.

“Ahhh” he moaned as cold liquid poured into his shoulder. Too much in his own head and he hadn’t heard her move around. “What the fuck!”

“Vodka to cleanse the wound. Now that you’re awake, we need to get that bullet out.

“No shit, Sherlock.”

“While you were playing sleeping princess in the car, I stole some bandages, tweezers, string and needles, and — well I don’t know what I got but I didn’t get caught and you haven’t died on me.”

“Yet?” At least she had enough energy to laugh. Not in shock and seemed capable of handling herself in a tight spot. He’d had clients who crumbled at the first sign of bloodshed. Laurel, as strong as she was graceful.

Fuck the ex-husband.

“What are these?” He asked when she put two pills in his hand. 

“Penicillin. I googled online and it seems broad enough to help you with the shoulder and anything else I’m about to do to you.” 

“How did you get them?”

“Small country town and I’m assuming the security camera in the chemist drugstore was only there for show.”

“Forget I asked, but what do you think you’re gonna do to me?”

“I have tweezers and if you can scream quieter than my daughter when she’s trying to get to sleep, I think I can get that bullet out before it does any more damage.”

“It’ll probably need stitches.”

“Oh, I took sewing class in high school, so let’s see how much I remember.” His face must have turned a whiter shade of grey because Laurel quickly put him at ease. “Relax, soldier, I used to be a nurse practitioner before I got married. I think I know what I’m doing.”

“Well, make it bloody quick, we don’t have all day.”

“How about you shut up and let me focus on this shoulder rather than whether I have a tomorrow to look forward to, okay?”

Kram had been patched up in the field often enough to appreciate soft hands with a firm touch. By a gorgeous nurse instead of hurried medics under fire.



Laurel held his shoulder still with her left hand, while the right hand deftly worked the tweezers. Kram bit down on his knuckles, wanting to prove to this woman he wasn’t some loser soldier-dude who got shot up at the first sign of trouble. Damn it, he’d taken five or six of them out and only got a couple of scratches in return. And the loss of his clothing, although his bloodied pants seemed to have been turned into strapping and a sling.

More importantly, Laurel was unscathed, and he could see the pram capsule set up on the backseat of his car. Probably the easiest place to keep warm, and if they had to make a quick getaway, all he had to do was send Laurel and the baby away while he held fire.

“Do you keep these as souvenirs?” She asked handing him the small bullet. How could such a tiny piece of metal hurt so bloody much!

“What makes you think I have a collection?”

“The number of scars. I counted four on your chest, two on your back.”

“Then you didn’t see my favorite one.” He grinned, happy to semi-flirt with the woman who had removed his blood-stained clothes and bathed him while he’d been too drowsy to help.

“You mean the one you caught in your ass?” she laughed. “Yeah, I’m sure there is a story or two behind it.”

“Or two?”

“Yeah, the story you tell your mum, the one you tell your mates and the one you tell your women. That’s three versions of the same story and I’m guessing they will all have enough of the truth to be believable.”

“Let me prove you right, how about once you and I get out here, I’ll tell it to you over a nice pub dinner.”

“Are you asking me out, Mr. Kram?”

“If I was, would you say ‘yes’?” It was worth asking.

“Do you realize how insane this sounds? Trying to seduce a woman who has a death sentence?”

“Do you know how crazy it is that anyone thinks they can walk up and kill you? Over my fucking dead body. And I’m not dead yet.”

“Then for my daughter’s sake, let’s keep it that way. Take your pills and watch your language. I didn’t rescue her from her father so she could learn from a potty mouth like you.”

“Has anyone pointed out that you are incredibly sassy?”

“Why no!” she joked. “Maybe that’s why someone wants to kill me.”

“Did anyone see you in town?” He turned serious, without trying to scare her but to cool his own fire.

“Always a soldier?”

“Only when it keeps you safe.”



Kram pulled himself into a seating position against the barn doorframe. He could see anyone approaching from the road through a gap next to the door hinge. As long as they kept things quiet and didn’t use the car or any other light to show the place was inhabited they should be safe here for a few days. The main risk was the baby crying.

“How old’s your daughter?”

“Seven months. We’ve been on the run for almost three.”

“What changed?”

“I don’t know what you mean?” Laurel checked on the sleeping baby before joining him.

“At some point, you left. Until then, you stayed.”

“I started saving even before I fell pregnant. Stashing away a couple of dollars here and there. Giving cash to friends and family to hold for me.”

“That took a lot of trust.”

“Better I find out who I could trust before I made my move. One of my friends turned me in. By the time my ex fronted me, I could show him the pregnancy test and spent the next months convincing him I wanted us to be a happy family.”

“Until you left.”

“I guess so.” He didn’t dare press her for more details. Former prisoners of war had a certain closed look. They could describe in great detail every star in the sky the night their world changed but couldn’t describe what happened. Trauma took time to process, accept and heal. He should know.

“Looks like my phone got smashed in our little altercation.”

“I have one – could we just swap the sim cards over?”

“Is it clean?”

“Secondhand shop, fake id, not tied to any network carrier. Did I pass?”

He gave her credit for smart and gutsy. “Who have you called on it?”

“I haven’t. I use it for the internet. One of my favorite Instagrammers posts hundreds of photos each week. I post a ‘Wish I was there’ with two emojis each day to let my family know we are fine.”

“Good to know.”

“Doug, glad you picked up.” He rang Captain Doug Whitehead who at least remain gainfully employed in the Australian Army and had useful connections. “Remember that party we got invited to for Staci?”

Please, figure it out.

“Yeah, good times. Unfortunately, I did all the planning but didn’t get to go.”

“Can’t talk long, but can you give me a call about another party? Same kind of host.”

“What the hell — ”

“Call me when you have a chance.”

“What was that all about?” Laurel looked as if he’d gone mad. “Party? Are you kidding me?”

“It’s all good. A couple of months back, a few friends got together to rescue a woman. Scum-bag ex-husband thought she owed him some money and tried to beat it out of her and her father.”

“Oh, my!”

“The guy I called — ” Kram broke into a smile when the phone rang. “Yeah?”

“You wanted a secure line, talk to me.”

“Hiding out in a small deserted farm outside Junee in country New South Wales. Actively hunted by cranky ex-husband who wants to be a widower and single father.”

“Understood. What do you need?”

“Safe transport for mum and seven-month-old daughter. ASAP. They’ve been on the run for almost three months and could do with a safe bed and warm food. Then I need to organize a party to make sure they stay safe.”

“How hot is the situation?”

“I may have hurt six boogies.”

“Hurt?”

“Three permanently, the other three dunno.”

“They are all permanent,” Laurel said. “You did five, I can only take credit for one.”

“Shit!” Doug cried. “Did I hear that right?”

“She’s as tough as Staci without the emotional baggage. I’m doing this pro-bono. Ask Vinn for details.”

“Got a place in mind?”

“Looking for a friend who won’t mind a baby.”

“I’ve got a couple of ideas. Do you need clothes, nappies and stuff?”

Kram handed the phone over to Laurel. “Tell him what you and the baby need.”

“Hi, I need nappies, wipes, formula, a couple of fresh blankets for the pram that she’s sleeping in and maybe a 00-size sleeping bag.”

“That’s what the baby needs,” he heard Doug ask. “What about you.”

“I’m fine. I’ll be fine. Nothing that a shower wouldn’t fix.”

Kram took back the phone. “You doing anything stupid?” Doug asked. 

“If you can get to the RAAF base in Wagga under the pretense of work, it’s only an hour away.”

“I’ll pull some strings; how many should we invite to the party?”

“I don’t know how well connected this guy is. The friends I’d usually trust could be the next ones on his calling card.”

“And they’ll be loyal to the money?” Doug guessed.

“I can afford to go pro bono, most can’t. If you have friends you can trust, bring them in, otherwise I’ll do it on my own.”

“I’ll call a family reunion. Wagga it is — stay safe one more night and we should be in touch tomorrow.”

“Thanks.”

In all, the conversation ended just under three minutes. Even if the signals were being tracked off local towers, it would give a general direction and not their address.



“Do you have any kids?” Laurel asked Kram after he played with Jasmine until the poor little girl fell asleep in his arms. The huge smile was her reward that yet again, she trusted the right stranger.

“Not that I know of.”

“Player?” She hated the thought of him treating women like disposable objects.

“More like married to my work. Moving around, no questions asked and not even being able to commit to where I’ll be for dinner on Sunday doesn’t go down well with women. They want stability, put down roots.”

“Lonely?” This time her eyes said more than her words. She’d convince her doctor to forbid sexual contact during pregnancy and her post-partum period. Her body craved the touch of another person. Consensual, gentle, passionate touches. Surviving the attack only heightened her need to be held and to hold.

“Sometimes, but then a new job comes along and there’s another damsel to be saved.”

Laurel could infer that he slept with all his clients, or none of them. She only cared whether or not he wanted her. “How’s the shoulder?”

“Rough, but it’ll be fine.”

“Can I take a look?” She’d noticed he’d been favoring it while playing with Jazy. Not that he’d let her strap it or anything that screamed “injury.”

“Let me put the sleeping princess back in her castle.” Kram had fashioned a mobile above the pram capsule. Half a dozen small padlocks glistened in the sunlight, strung together with a chain attached to the suit hangers above the back doors. 

“You are good with her.”

“She’s a good kid. Look at her getting sleep in a new place-as if she slept through the excitement to get here.”

“That’s just the thing, she never settles this quickly.”



Kram knew he’d lost a fair bit of blood just by his lack of energy. Content to sit and pretend to keep watch, surely there were things in this old farm shed they could put in place to give them a chance under ambush.

The back doors were rusted shut with no access from outside to the high windows. One entry to guard, but also only one escape. The car had almost a full tank of petrol and it seemed that the old owners had used the barn to house staff, maybe seasonal workers or shearers. A stack of musty mattresses were piled against a wall and another on a rusty wire bed frame. Still, they’d have to be more comfy than the floor.

“I ran the water and it now looks clear!” Laurel’s excitement was infectious, as she handed him a glass with water that no longer resembled the color of old copper pipes.

“Great.” Using the last of his strength, he pushed open a small door with his left shoulder. “And now we have what some real estate agents would call a ‘quaint ensuite’.”

“A bathtub and toilet! Why not a shower?”

“Don’t question the gods that provide. How about we see if there’s some soap somewhere and you can have a long bath. Jazy is asleep and we’ll be losing light soon.”

“Fine.”

Kram tried not to imagine Laurel undressing in a room where the door had kamikazed off its hinges. After taking one of the mattresses outside to belt out the dust, he came back in suffering from a coughing fit, aching arm and covered in a light grey film. A crusty old cloth scrapped the worst, but he no longer had the energy to clear a second mattress. It wouldn’t be the first time he half dozed sitting up on watch.

“I might use that bathwater when you’re finished,” he called out.

“Why wait until then?” An offer he didn’t expect. No matter how much their flirting had bordered on dangerous territory, he didn’t make a habit of bathing with women he couldn’t sleep with. Or sleep with women he was protecting.

“I’m good,” he called back.

“You mean, you don’t want to wash my back?” 

He checked on the sleeping baby, this would be a good time for Jazy to save her mummy from doing something stupid. Of course, she was fast asleep with cute little nose twitches. Damn, he’d never felt attached to a kid before, then again, this was his first rescue situation involving a kid. Not that he wanted to hear or see anything out of the usual, but even signs of life out on the highway would give him a reason to avoid — 

“Kram, at least tell me how we got here?”

That, he could do. 

Standing in the doorway, Kram kept his gaze high, grateful for the deep tub that protected Laurel’s modesty. 

“How much do you know, or have guessed?”

“I know that we didn’t get a chance to know each other before we were rudely interrupted. Your name is Kram, but I don’t know what that stands for or where you came from. I assume you found out my ex has plans for me, but I don’t know how you found me or who’s paying you.”

“First, no one is paying me.” Kram said proudly. “Where I come from, men don’t try and hold onto women who want to leave. We focus on making them so fucking happy that they never even think about it.”

“I like the sound of that,” she flirted, and splashed more water on where he could imagine her breasts were hidden behind the tub.

“I used to be a commando and now people contract with me to do stuff.”

“Like?”

“Find people, extract people. If there is a company with staff who have been detained in a foreign country subject to a financial settlement, they send me in to do the negotiating.”

“Are you good with your words?”

“Not as good as I am with my body.” Help him, he didn’t even mean to say that.

“Kram,” Laurel stood, her skin luminous in the fading light. “We’ve had a big day and I don’t want to be alone. Are you going to wash my back, or am I going to wash yours?”

“Not a good idea.” Damn it, this wasn’t a good time for his stupid morals to kick in. “A friend recently lost his shit over a girl he was supposed to be protecting.”

“Where are they now?”

“Engaged and living happily ever after, but that’s not my point.”

“Then I’ll be blunt.” Laurel splashed more water over her breasts, teasing him with the droplets cascading down. “My ex has a lot of money and there will be people out there paid handsomely to find me. Chances are, Jazy won’t be raised by her mother, and I’m not going to die of old age.” She said so matter of fact.

“I won’t let that happen.”

“But if it does, don’t I deserve one night?”

“Laurel,” he hadn’t said her name aloud before. So graceful, beautiful, strong. “I don’t do one-night stands and I’ve never been good at relationships.”

“So, keep me alive for longer than one night.”

One step and he had full view of her body as she handed him a dripping sponge. Gently brushing it down one arm and then the other, he didn’t care that his appreciation for her was pressing through his spare pants. “Turn around,” he knew if he started at her breasts, nothing else would matter. At least he could calm himself by washing her back. Except, the tell-tale scars caught the running water. Welts that pooled the water until it ran down her back like a snakes and ladders game.

“Wanna talk about it?” He needed to offer her the choice.

“Does it offend you?” She looked over her shoulder.

Fuck, he was lost. Forgetting he was still covered in dust, or that they’d only met hours ago, Kram cupped her face towards him, angrily taking her lips for his own. Crushing her against him until she pulled the shirt over his head, helping him extract his right arm. 

“Join me.” Her words music to his ears as he dropped and kicked his pants to the side and joined her in the large tub. Once he found the way she liked to be kissed, long and hard, he turned her and felt her tremble as he kissed each scar. His hands cupping her breasts as he moved down her back and kissed between her cheeks. Spinning her again, his tongue went everywhere he wanted to follow.

“Kram, please, oh, please,” she cried, pulling his hair as she spasmed. “I’ve never — I mean — oh, I’ve never.”

Neither had he, at least not like that. 

He held her waist, gently lowering her back down into the tub. The pleasure on her face was all the reward he needed, unsatisfying, but rewarding.

“You okay?” he shook water off a foot, twisting around to get out of the tub.

“Where do you think you’re going?” Lauren pulled him off balance until he almost fell on top, splashing water over the sides. Only bracing at the last minute with his sore arm.

“Shit! Damn!”

“Well, that will teach you!” She checked his shoulder, “At least you didn’t start it bleeding again.”

“We don’t have to — ” he couldn’t even finish. Not when her legs were spread around him and all he had to do was adjust.

“Yes, we do.” This time, her lips found his, her arms stroked every ripple of his chest before working their way down. 

“Oh!” he moaned as she held him. Only to become speechless when she helped him find his way inside.

Challenged by the confined space, one arm, and not wanting to stop kissing even for a minute, Kram found a rhythm that had Laurel purring his name, again. At least his right hand could be good for something, and as if they’d been lovers for one thousand years, he knew how to time her to perfection. Her second and his first as the sun gave way behind the clouds.


Wrapped together in a rug he kept in the car trunk, “I think my sweater looks better on you.”

“Oh, this old thing!” she laughed, “What does “Reapers” stand for anyway?”

“A bunch of guys that toured together. I wasn’t really one of them, but after we did each other a couple of favors, they gave it to me as an ‘Honorary Reaper’.”

“Let me guess, that was code for, different unit. You both got caught in a situation, lives were lost but you all returned safely because you made sure only the baddies died.”

“Pretty sharp for a girl who isn’t used to the lifestyle.”

Jazy stirring interrupted their conversation until she lay on the mattress between them.

“Can you sleep like this?” Laurel asked. “I mean, she’s only little but she takes up a lot of room.”

“If I can’t sleep, I’ll keep watch. Right now, the two of you deserve some rest. When was the last time you got a good night’s sleep?”

“Before I fell pregnant.” Her response shocked him. “Making the decision to leave was hard, planning it without being able to write anything down was almost impossible and I’d lie awake at night trying to think of everything that I’d forgotten. Then, we’ve been on the run and no sounds seem normal.”

“I can’t promise you that they won’t find us, but it’s unlikely they’ll find us tonight. Thanks to you grabbing my bags, we’ve got a couple of guns, plenty of ammo and eight of my best friends.”

“That oilskin?”

“Six throwing knives.”

“And the other two.”

“Different kind of knives.” 

“So, he wants me dead?” Laurel hadn’t spoken about her ex. Carefully, Kram helped her to crawl over the sleeping Jazy onto his chest.

“Yes, he wants you gone and his daughter back. A guy I do some work for said he had a job — lost wife. But the client had a heap of paperwork and non-disclosures to be signed. I don’t do paperwork, so handed it off.”

“What happened?”

“He found another supplier. Got them to sign all the papers, but when they looked into it, they bailed. The guy didn’t seem right and after a few beers, admitted his true intentions. My contact got in touch and asked if I’d help out pro-bono.”

“You didn’t even know me.”

“I knew enough,” he pulled out her picture. “I didn’t know about Jazy, only that the woman in this photo didn’t deserve to die because she married the wrong guy.”

“How do I thank you?” Laurel started kissing his chest.

“No, not like that!” He pushed her away. “Never touch me like that out of gratitude or because you think you are thanking me. What we did back there, what I am more than willing to do again if we get this bed to ourselves, has to be because you want it, with me.”

“What if you don’t want to?”

“Oh, sweetheart, that isn’t even a question!”

Laurel fell into a deep sleep on top of him, only stirring when Jazy needed a feed. “Babe, Laurel, sweetheart?” he gently rocked her until she sat up in shock.

‘Jazy!” she cried.

“Shh, she’s probably just hungry or needs a change. How about you give me some light from your phone and I’ll see if I can change her nappy.”

“How about you put her bottle together and I change her nappy, believe me, it’s not for the faint-hearted!”

“I’ll have you know I laugh in the face of danger.” He rolled off the end of the bed, not wanting to disturb Jazy who was now playing with her toes.

“Yeah, but have you ever laughed in the face of a dirty nappy? I didn’t think so.”

In almost dark, he figured out how much formula to how much water and handed the bottle over to mother and child. He’d done some crazy, messed up and outright criminal if not legally sanctioned shit in his life. Never had his actions seemed so meaningful.

“Thanks. He doesn’t really love her, or me,” Laurel explained softly as Kram checked outside. All clear, thank goodness. Still he made a mental note of keeping his bag of tools close by, just in case. At the first sound of danger, the girls could be packed into the car. He’d already positioned it so a good hit of the barn door at speed would give them a minute’s head start. If Laurel could point and shoot, as long as the baby was covered and protected, they’d have a chance.

“You don’t have to talk.” But the more she did, the more he’d know the sort of person he was up against. Chances of getting to Wagga were good. Finding and eliminating the threat, would take a little bit of luck, work and any intel she could give him.

“He never liked someone else playing with his toys or losing them.”

“Is that all you were to him?”

“Marriage meant ownership. I know that sounds crazy, especially since I have a degree, used to have a profession.”

“Sweetheart, I don’t judge you and I don’t blame you, and I’ve seen some messed up shit happening when a guy says the words, ‘I love you but.’”

Laurel semi-sang, with a wry laugh, “I love you, but-you’re the wrong culture. I love you, but-you’re the wrong age. I love you, but-your hair is too long, or too short. I love you, but-you dress like a slut. I love you, but — ”

Kram interrupted, “It’s okay, you really don’t have to explain to me.”

Laurel welcomed him back onto the bed, “But how am I supposed to explain to my daughter?”

Kram replied without thinking, “I loved your father, but he didn’t want to treat us the way we deserve.”

“Thank you, I really think I needed to hear that. Sometimes I think that it would be better off if I just let him kill me. He’s got the money and everything to look after her. I don’t have anything — what sort of life are we going to lead? Always on the run, always looking up over our shoulder and what if she gets killed in crossfire while he’s trying to get me?”

Her tears were real, and Kram could only stroke the side of her face and lay his first kiss on Jazy’s soft cheek.

“Shh, babe, please. You underestimate me. I’m supposed to be good at my job and getting you out of this alive is what I’ve been trained to do.”

“You said my ex tried to employ you, who’s paying you now?” The fact Laurel hadn’t remembered their conversation from before told Kram that she was still suffering from shock. While their time together in the bath was real to him, for Laurel it could have been a polite diversion and better forgotten by morning. 

“Well that’s the joke, you know ‘a funny thing happened on the way to the office’. I didn’t like the idea of a woman being killed for leaving her ex-husband, so a few friends and I decided to pitch in and rectify the situation.”

“What do you mean rectify the situation.”

“It means your safety is not optional but his is.”



They had put Jazy to sleep in her pram capsule, inside the unlocked car with windows down. The right balance between keeping her warm, safe and ready for a quick get-away if needed. Even though Laurel slept soundly in his arms, Kram only dozed. A twilight between awake and asleep, ready to respond at the slightest threat. By the time the morning cry of native birds heralded a new day, he carefully rolled Laurel away so he could do a scout around the barn. Nothing of concern, they had a clear view of anyone approaching the property. Based on the single motorbike out for an early morning ride, sounds travelled quickly and would give them a good warning and not a single soul tending fields or powering drones.

By the time he returned to the barn, Laurel held Jazy between her legs on the bed, playing with her padlock mobile. 

“I like a kid that can be easily amused with stuff from the garage.” The connection from yesterday only strengthened in daylight. Protecting them had never been about doing a job, but now it had become personal. Whatever it took, Laurel would be safe to raise her daughter wherever she wanted. 

“The sun is almost strong enough to play ‘spotto’, reflecting the glare from the padlock on the walls. Look at her laugh.”

If anyone had told him that he could spend the morning playing with someone else’s baby, he’d have restrained them for their own protection or had them committed.

A lifetime of pushing his body beyond its limits, travelling to ride the largest waves; going into the dirtiest battles where he could see the whites in a man’s eyes before taking him out. Only to turn to a sentimental mush because of a woman he’d met yesterday and her child? 

“I think it’s time for her nap,” Laurel suggested while they shared one of his ration packs. “How about I put her down and take a look at that shoulder.”

“Are you suggesting another bath?”

“We could have a ‘bath’ without the water!” she blushed. “Or I could check your wound and make sure I didn’t accidently kill you.”

“Fine.” While Laurel settled Jazy with a bottle, he struggled out of his shirt. The pain he could ignore, but the stiffness could be a problem.



Where did he come from and what had she done to deserve him! 

Laurel blushed at the thought of what they’d done in the tub and then again in bed. Fumbling with the antiseptic and swabs, at least she steadied her hand carrying the water over to Kram and the bed. This time, Laurel took her time, checking the wound, changing the dressing before lightly sponging the rest of his body. Not enough water to reach the mattress, but enough to give her reason to explore his chest. 

Guessing from the shape of each scar the cause, but not the why. What would make a man risk his life for two strangers? Old bullet wounds, and what Kram called “scratches,” but had to be knife wounds gave her a sense of comfort. This was a man that didn’t just stand back at 2000 metres and launch rockets at his enemies. This was a man that could go hand to hand and still walk away.

“Enjoying yourself?” he asked as she moved to sit behind him, with unrestricted access to smother his back in kisses while her fingers explored his abs.

“More than I probably should.”

“You don’t have to do this.” Kram held her hands to his lips.

“I know, but I want to. I owe you so much.”

“Heat of battle, the adrenaline’s pumping and two people come together. What we did yesterday … what I mean to say is that you don’t owe me anything and it didn’t have to mean a thing.”

“Are you saying yesterday and last night didn’t mean anything to you?” He could lie to himself, but she had been in his arms. Every kiss had been honest and each touch for her pleasure, not his.

“I’m saying that we need to get you safe and then you can start thinking about the rest of your life, but whatever happens, you don’t owe me anything.”

“I owe you my daughter’s life.” For Laurel, the two truths weren’t connected. They owed Kram for saving them, but what she felt in his arms was because of the man.

“You owe me nothing.”



At least flirting took his mind off the impossible situation they faced. If the ex suspected whoever intervened in Junee had a military background, then Wagga would be already under surveillance. Laurel’s phone worked, but it wasn’t secure and any teenager with a kit could hack in. He had no idea how he was going to get Laurel to safety, only that succeeding wasn’t an option. 

He much preferred trying to keep Laurel’s spirits high. The last thing he needed was for her to start panicking or second guessing herself, or him. 

Not that he really needed an excuse to flirt and banter.

_Proxy: One hour_

_Shit._ He didn’t expect Doug to call in the calvary. How many freebies would he owe Proxy for helping out? Didn’t matter. 

_Kram: Make sure the beer’s cold._

_Proxy: Day for schooners not middies_

“What’s that all about?” Laurel read the texts over his shoulder. “Who’s Proxy and why are you using my phone to arrange your next drinking session?”

“Proxy was the first contact your ex tried before I passed on the job. I don’t know how he got involved again, but it’s a good thing. Proxy has more contacts than most in the business and I trust him. Think about it. If anyone was hacking into your phone, they found out nothing to hurt us. The guys are an hour away from Wagga. If we leave now, we’ll probably get there around the same time.”

“And the beer?”

“Middies is they’ve packed light. Schooners — ”

“They’re ready for what you guys call a real ‘party’?”

“Something like that. Let’s pack up the car, leave everything the way we found it.”

“What about fingerprints?”

“Mine don’t exist and by the time anyone traces yours, there’ll either be dust over the top again or you’ll be safe.”

“Are we really doing this?” For the first time since they arrived that the barn, the scared little girl looked out from the lavender woman eyes.

“Sweetheart,” one last hug couldn’t hurt. “You started this party, now let me help you finish it.”



“Not again!” Straight after introductions in the carpark outside the Wagga base, Vinn pulled him aside. “I thought you were smarter than this! How long has it been? Less than a day and already you’ve fucked the client.”

“Mate, I love you like a brother, but if you talk about Laurel like that again, I promise, I’ll forget we are blood.”

“Have you forgotten what we went through with Ed. Clouded judgement, mate. You can’t be thinking clearly if your dick’s involved.”

Just because Doug was right didn’t make the words easy to hear. “I know, I know. I know better but got emotionally involved. No excuses, but you can’t let my stuff up turn this into a cluster-f.”

“You’ve gotta forget she’s your woman and treat her like a client. Starting now.” Doug didn’t give him room for negotiation.

“Are we okay?” Laurel bounced Jazy in her arms, coming between Kram and his mates. There was no hiding her body language from Doug or the others. 

Damn it.

“We were discussing how to get you out of here with minimal fuss.” He kept his tone firm and measured, giving away nothing of his feelings. They were irrelevant.

“What?” He hated the look of hurt that briefly crossed her face. “Aren’t I going with you?”

“No need. I only needed to get you safe.” He wanted to look away, or take away the cutting edge of his tone. Ed’s emotions almost cost lives, Kram had to be smarter. Client, only a client.

“What happens now?” When cold, her lavender eyes were almost blue. 

“You’ll be coming back to Sydney with me.” Doug broke in, handing her a bag. “There should be enough nappies and formula in there for the drive. We’ll be joining a military detail. They left about an hour ago, but they’ll be stopping for lunch and we’ll catch up then. Jumping in the back of a jeep might not be the most comfortable ride, but you’ll be protected all the way. 

“What happens when we get to Sydney?” Kram asked Jax who joined them. Jax led the planning to rescue the Colonel’s daughter and Kram trusted his judgement implicitly.

“Your old friends from the wharf think one of Vinn’s team rescued the girl and have her stashed at the MC club house in Campbelltown.”

“What the fuck? Why would we involve them?”

Vinn and Jax shared a glance before Jax explained, “Chill, it’s easy. You say they are ruled by money, but they turned up to help Ed and Staci. If they crash the party with force, the MC will sort them out.”

“Is Snake still riding?” Kram hadn’t seen his fellow commando in a year or so. After struggling with PTSD, Snake found peace riding and the brotherhood of the club gave him a family outside Army.

“Yeah, he was the one who suggested it. His money is on your friends reaching out to negotiate a solution where they keep their money and we keep the girl.”

“And the ex?”

“Doesn’t even get to keep the right to next Christmas, sorry miss,” Vinn apologized to Laurel. “Between Snake and your old friends, we’ll set the trap. The client has to collect the package in person, and something about a real man cleaning up his own mess.”

“Bait him into going to the club house?”

“Hardly anyone knows about our connection to Snake. As plans go, it isn’t bad. As plans developed, agreed and put in place in less than 24 hours, I think you’re bloody lucky.”

Doug came back, “Okay, the car seat is fitted, and if my new fake bride could please put on her blonde wig, as soon as she and Kram have said their ‘goodbyes’ we can get this show on the road.”

“I’m ready now,” Laurel took the wig and led Doug back to his car without so much as a backward glance.

Kram could only watch her leave before turning back into the cold-hearted killer he needed to be, for her.



“Mate,” Mr. Black greeted him in the pub car park, around the corner from the MC club house. “They didn’t tell me this was your party.”

“I guess they were trying to figure out whose side you’d be on.” Kram had a long professional association with Mr. Black and his team. If people thought Kram could be ruthless, well, Mr. Black was the master.

“Kram, my friend,” Mr. Black’s laugh didn’t reach his eyes. “Always the money, unless killing a woman is involved. Heard there is a kid as well?”

“Yep. Seven-month-old little girl. Apparently, daddy wants his little princess back and the mother out of the picture, permanently.” Kram tried to keep the emotion from his voice. For two days since reaching Sydney, he’d all but begged Doug to put Laurel on the phone. Only to be refused access — not by Doug, but by the lady herself.

Could he have just been a “friendly fuck under fire” — convenient when getting her out of danger. Yeah, nah. She couldn’t have faked the hurt when he brushed her away in Wagga. There would be some serious fence-mending required once this was over. 

Damn it! Kram had to stop thinking in terms of candlelight and picnics. Needed to get his head in the game — remembering her in his arms wasn’t going to get his dick hard for battle.

“Apparently the ex doesn’t believe in divorce or custody battles, not when he can pay for a more immediate solution,” he finished to Mr. Black shaking his head.

Mr. Black metered out his own form of justice, for a living and for fun. “That’s messed up. What do you want from me and the boys?”

“Make sure he comes to make the collection himself. Tell him that you don’t mind the killing, but it is more respectful for a husband to pull the trigger himself. Tell him that you’ll supply a clean gun and all he has to do is point and shoot.”

“What if he wants a gun?”

“Give him this one.” Kram handed over his old favorite. Only an expert would know that the firing pin was in place but sabotaged. He was willing to bet his life on it and trusted Mr. Black’s team not to “fix” it.

“What about our rep in the community-we can’t be seen to take money and not do the job.”

“It’ll be fine. They’ll be so much chaos that no one will really know what happened if they weren’t in the room. If anything goes down, it’ll be on me. The client engaged both of us, and got killed as we settled a business dispute.” Kram’s reputation preceded him and Mr. Black’s wasn’t far behind. “From the way I see it, if we sell it right and with the same story, no one will try to play us off against each other again!”

“Roger that, I don’t feel respected when clients try to make us bid against each other.”

“I don’t bid and I don’t do paperwork, which is how I got involved in this situation,” Kram laughed. “Serves me right, I guess.”

“They offered it to you first? Fuck, I had no idea.”

“No hard feelings, let’s get in, do our job and be home for dinner.” Kram extended his hand. He had few friends in the business, but Mr. Black and his team had come through on more than one occasion. 

“Who’s doing the cleaning?”

“I am.”

Kram wouldn’t have it any other way.



“What’s going on?” Laurel knocked before entering Doug’s study. The large house seemed to be two homes in one. The family home with kids toys everywhere and scattered bundles of washing to be folded, and then Doug’s wing. Three rooms filled with computer and tv screens that seemed to live stream from places with names she’d never be able to pronounce.

“You shouldn’t be in here.” Doug didn’t even look up from his computer. “Now’s not a good time.”

Suddenly, the middle screen went blank and then new vision emerged of a wood panelled room, maybe a bar room? The camera kept jolting around as if either hand-held or attached to a body, scanning across half a dozen heavy-set men in black jackets standing around a slight woman. “What’s going on – why is she wearing my clothes?” Laurel’s confusion only increased when the woman’s black short curls were tucked under a wig of soft long brown waves. “Doug, please! What are they doing?” 

“Dougie, can you see that?” Kram’s voice came over the computer.

“Check, hold your position.” Doug replied with a quick look towards Laurel but she ignored his attempt to wave her away. “They are setting up the decoy now. Have you got visual on outside? What’s the ETA?”

“All good here. ETA is ten, I repeat, one zero minutes. If anything goes wrong — ”

“Don’t worry, mate. We’ll get her to Staci’s while you clean up the mess.”

“Ed’s okay with that?”

“He insisted. If he was in the country, he’d be there with you.”

Who were these people, Laurel grabbed the microphone from Doug, needing answers but instead spoke from her heart, “Kram, it’s me. Please be careful.”

“Fuck, what’s she doing there!” Kram yelled. “She has no place getting involved in this shit. Get her out of the room, NOW!”

“But!” she cried as Doug took back the microphone and shoved her out of his study. 



Kram couldn’t end the call with Doug quickly enough. What the hell had the guy been thinking, letting Laurel see what they had planned. And Laurel — for days he’d been trying to talk to her when he could then get his head back in the game, but today she decides to hijack his thoughts!

_Focus, breathe, focus._ Kram opened his mind to accept the calmness that he only found out in the surf and before doing a job. Senses heightened; his heart rate slowed. The opposite of what should happen but set him apart from other soldiers. He found peace in their disorder and chaos.

Kram heard the arrival before the warning came through his earpiece. A heavy Mercedes sounded out of place in this part of town. His vantage point from the waiting room of a friendly tattoo parlour across the road gave clear line of sight when Mr. Black opened the driver’s door for a slight man. Shorter and smaller than Kram expected, he walked with the same entitled arrogance as his photo. The guy still had a chance to call things off, but from the way he snatched Kram’s gun off Mr. Black, today wasn’t about to end well for at least one of them.

“Thank you, ladies,” Kram farewelled the tattoo artists after tipping them for seeing nothing.

By the time he’d crossed the road, everyone was in place. Doug, Jax, Mr. Black and his microphones were all feeding into earpieces. Jax was right, this could actually work.

“So you see, Mr Moreno, we have your wife waiting for you.” Mr. Black could have been offering a painting rather than a life. “We came in, encouraged the bikers that your money was better than what they’d been offered.”

“Where are they now?”

“Taking a lunch break. You don’t have long,” Mr. Black looked up as Kram stepped into the room.

“You! You were supposed to do the job.”

“I like money but don’t do paperwork. These friends of yours needed my help but didn’t ask me to read and sign shit.” Kram took advantage of the confusion to cross the room. He needed to be close, just in case.

“Then what the hell are you doing here?”

“Making sure you don’t screw things up or leave a trace.”

“We also felt,” Mr. Black added, “That given your previous discussions, it would be better if Kram took an active part in case his loyalty was later questioned.”

“Smart,” Moreno nodded. “But he left six of my ‘friends’ lying on the ground without a pulse. I can’t let him get away with that.”

Kram looked to Moreno’s gun being waved around by a fool. The plan relied on the single bullet being fired at the fake hostage who played her part, silently writhing underneath a pillowcase. He needed to end things quickly before she did something to give away the subterfuge.

“Money or blood?” Kram asked, standing between Moreno and the girl. With a slight adjustment of his body, most of his team were now directly behind Moreno and could take him down with little more than a wink from Kram.

“What?” Moreno asked, looking around and sweating. 

“You want money for the bodies, or do you want to draw my blood?” Kram smiled easily, they needed the guy to either change his mind and kill the job or make his move so they could finish it. Slowly and without scaring Moreno, Kram opened his jacket to show his only display knife, taking it out by the blade and handing it over. “You get one go. Draw my blood and then let’s get this over with. I’ve wasted enough of my time on your bloody ex-wife.”

“Where’s my daughter?” 

“She’s with my sister at a safe house nearby,” Mr. Black interrupted, also intent on diffusing the new tension. “I didn’t want the little girl to be present at such a time, we don’t know what babies remember. I assumed you would want her to know that her father is a gentle, kind man.”

“Yeah right.” Moreno held the knife to Kram’s cheek. The longer he paused, he more his hand shook before handing the knife back. “I’ll take the money. All of it.”

“The other guys will insist on their cut.” Kram negotiated, playing the game. “I’ll hand over my share, but the others deserve to get paid.”

“That’s your problem.” Before anyone had time to react, Moreno stepped to the side, raised the gun to the woman’s head and pulled the trigger.



Laurel screamed from the doorway as the gun fired and nothing happened. Doug jumped up, covering her face with his body as she cried, “What’s happening!”

“Damn it, you should have stayed away.”

“What happened!”

“Kram fixed his gun to make sure it wouldn’t fire, but as a backup, they used a blank.”

“The woman, she’s alright?” Laurel struggled to turn back to watch the woman being helped from the room by two of the black knights while Kram faced her ex-husband. “What’s he going to do?”

This time, Doug pushed her from the room, “You know what he’s going to do, but you don’t need to watch. Go, hug your daughter and know that you’ll be safe.”

She’d loved Moreno for years before they married. Always knowing that underneath the expensive suits lay a man who could hate with a vengeance, but his cruelty only became apparent after she wore his ring and became his possession. 

Still, even after he sent those six men after her, even after Kram told her what Moreno planned to do, nothing prepared her to see him pull the trigger on a woman he thought was her. 

How could a man she once loved, want her dead — and so badly he could do it himself?

Jazy picked the perfect time to wake from her morning sleep with happy gurgles. Before she’d finished heating up a bottle of formula, Doug joined her in the kitchen. “Are you okay?”

“Don’t worry about me, what about Kram and your friends?”

“He wants to talk to you.” Doug started the coffee machine as if he hadn’t spoken. “But he also knows this wasn’t the life you ever wanted, and that the timing between you may have been off.”

“Off?” Laurel sniggered. “That’s like saying …” Instead of finishing her thoughts, she returned to the now grizzling Jazy. Yes, their timing had been “off” but — 

She wanted Kram in her life, but — he had killed people, and probably would again.

She needed Kram in her life, but — what if a lifetime couldn’t be built base on one night together?

Laurel didn’t believe in insta-love, but — Kram had been willing to risk his life for a woman he didn’t know. But — he didn’t flinch when Moreno held the knife to his face. Steady as a rock, and ready to be hurt if it kept her safe.

But — even knowing what her ex planned to do, Kram waited until Moreno pulled the trigger before finishing the job.

_She didn’t want to be just another job._

“You said you had a friend with a property that I could go to for a few days?” If Doug noticed her broken voice or red eyes, he didn’t call her out on it.

“Staci went through something similar to you. Now she’s got a small property and breeds border collies. How about when Jazy is ready for her next sleep, we head off and she can sleep on the drive.”

“Sounds good.”

“What do I tell Kram when he asks.”

“I think he said it all, our timing was off.”



“Dude! You cut through those waves like a boss!” The young locals treated him like a returning hero on the beach. Up to six hours of surfing each day was enough to get his mojo back, but not enough to silence his regrets.

“Thanks,” he accepted the fist pumps. “That left break was nasty towards the end.”

“Which is why most of us came back in.”

“The harder the surf, the better I like it.” Kram had been looking at the surf reports. No reason to stay in Australia, he’d only be tempted to do something stupid.

Like get his ass back down to Sydney, drive two hours towards the Southern Highlands until he found Ed and Staci’s property. From all reports, their houseguest had settled in and once all investigations into her ex-husband’s sudden disappearance were over, she’d be free to rebuild her life.

“How long are you sticking around?” one of the youngsters asked. “A month is a record for you, right?”

“Dunno, think I’ll go over and check out Suluban in Bali.”

“I’ve only heard about it. Don’t you have to crawl on your knees to get to the surf, or something?”

“Nah, you gotta make your way down the cliff and through some rocks, but as long as the board gets through, the waves will be worth it.”

“Sic, dude, when are you going?”

“Tomorrow, if I can get the flights.”

Kram hadn’t made a decision until asked. Now, he couldn’t wait to pack up his board and get the hell out of Australia and find peace where the waves never ended.

_Proxy: New job. Interested?_

_Kram: About to head out of town._

_Proxy: No time urgency. Coffee?_

_Kram: Sydney International tomorrow._

_Proxy: Which coffee?_

_Kram: closest to QF45X to Indonesia_

_Proxy: Running or surfing_

_Kram: Want me to turn up or not?_



Answering a stupid message from Proxy had started this whole mess. No matter what the job, or how much it paid, he’d turn it down. Stay in Bali or travel the world until the “time urgency” became urgent and the job got handed over to someone else.

It took less time than usual to hand his unit keys over to a real estate agent. Within half a day, tenants had signed on the dotted line and even if he came back, he’d be homeless for at least a year. Not that he had many possessions, but those he wanted to keep fit into a couple of boxes to be stored at the surf club. For what he paid in donations, they were happy to do him a favour.

By the time he drove down to Sydney, dumped his car for a friend to collect, checked in his board and duffel bag, he decided against meeting up with Proxy. Nothing the guy could say would make him change his mind, and he respected Proxy too much to lead him on.

_Kram: Rain check when I get back._

No answer?

Whatever. Proxy was probably hitting his phone looking for Kram’s replacement.

“Do you think a cup of coffee is enough to thank someone for saving her life?”

Damn it! Laurel and Jazy were the last people he expected to see in the airport lounge, and at first he thought she was yet another figment of his imagination. He’d been dreaming of running into her at random places, but this was insane.

“Short black?” Still smiling, Laurel handed him a cup.

“Wow, she’s grown so much.” Ignoring the mother, he picked up the gurgling girl and tickled her until other passengers smiled at the giggles. “Jasmine, sweet Jasmine, you are a sight for sore eyes. What are you doing here?” Blowing raspberries on Jazy’s tummy was easier than facing her mother.

“Got time for a coffee?”

“I’m meeting a friend.” Suddenly, Proxy’s invite didn’t seem so hard.

“I know. I offered to pay Vinn to set up the meet, but apparently Ed owes you one and got Proxy to do it for free.” Laurel’s laugh matched her daughter. “Did I get that right and is anyone going to explain it to me?”

Kram escorted them to the end of the lounge, where he could still hear the boarding call but Jazy could crawl around on the floor. “I helped Ed protect Staci. Vinn helped Ed protect Elisha. Vinn wants Ed to come and work for him and I do the occasional job for Proxy and Vinn so they both want me to owe them.”

“Well, now I owe them.”

“Why? I told you before, you owe me nothing.”

“Actually, you owe me the truth.” Sitting next to him, hands in her lap, Laurel never looked more beautiful, or vulnerable.

“I’m not going to tell you what happened in the club house.”

“I don’t want to know. I saw him pull the trigger and then Doug got me out of the room.”

“You saw us talk?”

“And you handing him the knife. But that’s not what I want to know.”

_Passengers on QF45X to Indonesia, please be advised your plane has been delayed for three hours due to late arrival._

“I guess not all our timing is ‘off’,” Laurel smiled. “From memory, it took less than three hours for you to save my life the first time, less than another three hours from getting out a bullet to us sharing a bath.”

For almost three hours, they talked and Kram felt the same peace, calmness sitting with Laurel and her child as he did out on the surf or about to start a job.

_Attention, passengers on flight QF45X to Indonesia. Your flight has been cancelled. Please proceed to the information desk to rebook._

“It seems we have more time for you to tell me the truth.” Laurel stroked the scar down his left cheek. He’d even forgotten it existed until her finger caressed the raised edge.

“What do you want to know?”

“In the farmhouse — when we were together — was that real for you?”

“Of course!” He couldn’t believe she could ask. “But I get why you had second thoughts once we got back to town.”

“It wasn’t me — you were the one who pushed me away in front of your friends.”

“That!” No wonder she refused to take his calls. “I needed my head to be in work mode, needed them to see me as a soldier.” How could he make her understand, “I tried calling, to explain.”

“I didn’t need to hear you explain why this was such a bad idea.”

“Not bad, just bad timing.”

“And now — you’re running away to Bali and the flight gets cancelled. Would you say that’s good or bad timing?”

“I told you before, I’m no good at relationships.”

“I can see that, but neither am I.”

“My work isn’t mundane or boring.”

“Neither is life with a baby.”

He had one final argument, “I can’t be your rebound. I should never have taken advantage of you in the barn, but damn it, I felt something real.”

“I called you into the bathroom, remember? You’d lost a lot of blood. If anyone was taking advantage of the other, I’m guilty as charged.”

“Dah!” Jazy called from pram, reaching for him. “Dah! Dah!”

Kram knew she was pronouncing the easiest sounds, but the thought of being a father to this little girl and much more to her mother wouldn’t go away. If there was such a thing as selfless and unconditional love, he had it in spades. For them.

“What will it take for you to come away with me?” Kram didn’t need to go to information desk, all the flight availability was in the palm of his hand. “Bali, New Zealand  — I don’t care where we go, as long as the three of us are together. What would it take?” 

“Kiss me like you mean it.”

So he did.


“Kiss me like you mean it.”

So, he did.
