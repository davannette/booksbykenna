## Have you met ... Robert?

The restaurant door had never felt heavier to open than when Robert Zhang arrived late to the student association meeting. Only turning up out of obligation and because he’d run out of excuses – for himself, his friends and even his father who had suddenly taken a keen interest in his life. With fake bravado, he claimed the last chair at the table, refusing to apologize or acknowledge the other seven students with more than a brief nod. The familiar smells of traditional Chinese spices wrapped him in a warm hug, rewarding him for having the courage to finally leave his penthouse apartment on the Sydney eastern beaches. Not that his self-imposed prison had felt luxurious while hiding from the public cluster-f*ck his life had become.

Robert stared down the curious and sympathetic looks from the people he once considered his closest friends. Bound together by common heritage and challenges from moving to Australia to study. Until the last few weeks, they looked up to him because of his father’s position in the Party, wealth, supposed good looks and his effortless way of making friends across cultures. Without words, he’d felt the balance of power shift – how could it not when he was just another cuckolded, spoilt brat who’d finally been treated the way he deserved.

Swallowing his pride and forcing a confident arrogance he no longer felt, Robert appreciated the small smile from the petite bombshell, Sizzi Yang as he quickly caught up on their discussion, without admitting how little of the emails he’d read. Everything about the Cultural Festival had become synonymous with _her_. Quite frankly, the quicker they could all wrap up the last of the administration, the faster he could report back to his father, forget his mistake and move on.

“The feedback from the international universities and local students was better than we expected,” Sizzi gushed. “The last survey results came in last night so all we have to do is pull together the final report for our university, sponsors, and supporters, then we’ll be done.” Robert relaxed as she took control. Out of all the chaos and uncertainties, in Sizzi he could trust to bring her intense passion that became a magnet to others to follow. Short, bubbly and full of energy, Sizzi didn’t let the impossible stand in her way of getting things done – not for the first time, Robert basked in her enthusiasm for life.

“What were the headlines?” he asked, hoping that his personal issues hadn’t impacted on the actual Festival. 

“The university want to use it as a blueprint for other cultural festivals, the international student associations want us to pick a date for next year so they can plan their calendar’s around our event and some of the corporate sponsors want us to work with them to set up pitches for graduates that are culturally appropriate.”

“You did all that?” he marveled, looking around the table, making sure they all shared in the glory. “One small idea, and the people at this table brought it together. A bunch of university students and now corporates are looking to you for advice. People from around the world are demanding an annual event. You did that!”

He let the words sink in, motioning for the owner to bring a bottle of their favorite wine. Being regulars had its advantages, as did his credit card limit. “A toast,” he called after filling all glasses. “To each of you for making the impossible not only happen, but for bringing people together and making a difference.”

“To us!” 

“To Sizzi.”

“To everyone involved.” Jay came the closest to including _her_ in the toast. Robert tried not to care. After all, it had been _her_ idea that they all turned into an international Festival. Coordinating a week of cultural food, entertainment, sports across university campuses all over the world. Streaming live on large screens, beaming vision from Australia into British Columbia, Hong Kong into California. Driven by a bunch of university students and using the power of technology and social media to turn it into the event of the year.

“Where are we up to?” Now that he’d led a round of self-congratulations, it was time to find out what they’d volunteered him for during his absences.

“We’ve organized the last payments, and all the ‘thank you’ notes for sponsors and people who helped out on the day.”

“Who’s signing them off?” Robert challenged someone to say _her_ name, just so he could pretend not to care – maybe one day he wouldn’t.

“We thought you could, after all it was your family connections that pulled the day together,” Jay cautiously suggested. 

Robert allowed a small smile, it was actually a bloody clever idea with one possible twist, “How about you write the letter and I’ll ask my father to sign some of them.” Anything signed by a foreign diplomat would be better than a well-connected university student. 

With one offer, he could make up for not being around these past weeks. He could also make sure his father knew the names of everyone at this table and could even organize invaluable references and introductions. This group had worked hard, bloody well deserved it, and even though he never liked using his connections, this time was different.

“That would be great, if you think he would,” Sizzi beamed – a smile that brightened the room with her light.

“I can only ask – get me the list of names and the letter.” At the very least, his father might respect the quality of sponsors that had gotten involved, and some of the respect might filter down to the son.

“The last thing left is to write the report,” Sizzi hesitated at the collective groans. “I know that the Festival was challenging on a personal level and we’ve lost one of the organizers, but we still need to write up the lessons learned, where we have identified tangible benefits for the university, students, community and especially sponsors.”

“Use it as a pitch for next year?” he asked, already visualizing how powerful the document could become.

“Absolutely – I love how you think.” Sizzi then warned, “It’s not going to be easy – reviewing our own work and finding the right balance that will get read by the different audiences.”

“Something short and sharp to get their attention, backed up by the facts and figures in attachments?” Robert had seen enough investor pitches come across his father’s desk to know which ones got read and which ones got discarded.

“I guess, but we need a volunteer.”

Writing the report could easily become a poisoned chalice and Robert didn’t blame the rest of the table for not wanting to make eye contact – after all, the new batch of dim sims needed eating. Only Sizzi looked to him with hope.

“I’ll do it.” Robert ignored the assignments that had been backing up while he sheltered from the world. After all – there was nothing like holding the pen to determine history. When people looked back on what was destined to become an annual festival, he wanted _her_ name to be invisible – not even a report footnote in his personal humiliation. Writing the report would also ensure credit was evenly handed out to the other people at the table; not for him but for them. Robert only wanted two things from the report – his father’s respect for the individuals who had pulled together the Festival and never hearing or seeing her name again.

“I’ve got some notes you can use,” Sizzi offered, her eyes shining to match the open smile he’d become used to. He still couldn’t get used to the smatterings of bright pink streaks in her otherwise straight black hair, but they matched her uniqueness, her energy and constant zest for life. Just knowing she was on his side, Robert felt less like a failure but still guilty that he had let her and the others down.

“Look, I know I’ve been AWOL for the past couple of weeks.” Swallowing more pride, Robert addressed the self-indulgent pity party he’d been on since his break-up. Perhaps it wasn’t only his father’s respect he was after - these people had deserved more than his disappearing act. “Whatever you need done, hand it over. The letters, drafting the report, whatever you need.” 

The slightest shadow passed across Sizzi’s face and Robert quickly realized that while he didn’t want to work alone, Sizzi probably didn’t want to let go of all control. “Sizzi, I know that you’ve already done more than your fair share, but do you think we could work on the report together?”

“Why?” He didn’t expect the question, a simple yes or no would have been fine. 

“Because you made the Festival a success and the report should reflect your voice and the contributions of everyone at this table. I’ll write it – but it has to be your story.” Surprisingly, he realized that it was Sizzi’s respect he wanted the most.

“Fine,” she shrugged. “When do you want to start? I mean, we’ve only got a week to get it done.”

Damn, had he really lost track of time by that much? It seemed like only yesterday he found out about _her_ other lover and banned her from his apartment and life. Where had the weeks or month gone? “Tomorrow’s Saturday and I don’t have to work – if you’re free we should be able to smash out a good first draft over the weekend for everyone to look at on Monday?”

“Fine.”

Robert sat back for the rest of the meeting and tried to figure out why, if he was supposedly getting over a broken heart, was he feeling the long-forgotten butterflies of anticipation at spending the weekend with Sizzi? 

 

Sizzi’s hand shook as she answered the phone. “Hello, you,” she started, trying to keep her voice from betraying her nerves.

“So, I was thinking …” Robert’s voice filled her like warm honey.

“Did that hurt?” Sizzi teased, playing with her sports wearable – if he’d called any later it would have gone through to voice mail while she was on a run. Stupid buttons wouldn’t let her reset – in frustration, she ripped it off her arm and threw it across the room. 

Robert rang! Her heart sang. Robert rang!

“I guess I deserved that since I haven’t been really pulling my weight these last couple of weeks.” He at least sounded sincere and Sizzi knew how hard that would have been for most men to admit, let alone someone with as much pride as Robert. Before she could respond, he continued, “I thought I could pick you up and we could work out of my place.”

“I was about to go for a jog.” If he’d called ten minutes later, they wouldn’t be having this conversation and if he’d called any earlier, she’d be dressed more appropriately.

“Well, how about I pick you up and we can jog along the beach near my place?”

“And how exactly will that get the report finished?” She had to stop thinking of Robert as a man and remember why he’d offered to get together. Stop allowing her emotions to take over and remember how much it had hurt to watch him fall for someone who never deserved his attention let alone his love. Damn it – anyone could have predicted the outcome. Sizzi would never have treated Robert like that, not that he’d ever give her the chance, she thought.

“Well, we can talk at the halfway point, and by the time we get back, hopefully we’ll have come up with some brilliance to transcribe onto paper.”

“I guess, but we don’t have much time.” The truth was that Sizzi didn’t want Robert to see her all sweaty with her hair in disarray and make up disappeared. She wanted him to see her as her carefully crafted image -- always in control and the life of all parties.

“Nonsense, look if you’re uncomfortable about hanging around in your sweats, bring a bag and you can get changed at my house. I’ll even throw in some fresh towels and hot water.”

She immediately pictured Robert’s apartment on the eastern suburbs of Sydney, close to the beach and all the cafes. The group had used it as a base of operations for the week before and during the Festival, setting up a war room in his dining room. Sizzi had dreamt about standing in his shower as Robert accidently walked in, took one look at her naked body and realized that they belonged together. 

Fantasies and dreams. She couldn’t let down her guard and let him see how much she wanted to be the one to kiss away his pain. Maybe working together was a stupid idea and she should call the whole thing off. Robert was smart, he didn’t really need or want her help.

“How soon can you get here?” The words came out before she could stop them – but once said, she couldn’t take them back.

“If you’re still at the same place I’ll be there in fifteen minutes,” Robert answered as if it was the most natural response in the world. Sizzi knew he could never understand the turmoil his offer created. Surely, he had better things to do than hang out with her?

“See you then,” she closed her eyes, wanting to be strong enough to keep this strictly professional and knowing her heart had already failed every test.

“Do you mind if I text you when to come down? I know I should come up to get you, but parking is usually a nightmare.”

“It’s fine,” Sizzi hurriedly broke in. “I’ll wait for you downstairs, don’t bother texting.”

Only when Robert thanked her before hanging up, did Sizzi become filled with self-doubt – did that make her seem even more desperate? Fifteen minutes was long enough for her to overthink and second guess everything from what she was wearing to what to take. A long look in her mirror, Sizzi had dressed for comfort, not for a date; teaming her light grey sweatpants with a bright pink crop top that matched her hair and showed too much skin for a traditionally raised man like Robert. Or would he appreciate her as a modern woman? Sizzi stood frozen in front of the mirror before deciding – or at least trying to convince herself that there was no need to change into something else. No matter what her fantasies held - this was not a date!

 

He was going on a date! 

Robert couldn’t think of a day with Sizzi as anything but a date. Two people, wanting to spend time together. Who had things in common. He tried to deny how his body reacted to her presence in the restaurant. The little lick of her tongue across her lips when she was thinking, the subtle twirl of her hair while he spoke. Spending the day together could be dangerous – but only if he didn’t keep his emotions in check.

When he first dialed her number, he only had thoughts of spending the day – or possibly the weekend – at his house to work on the report. Now, he was looking forward to a jog along the beach, maybe followed by a lazy lunch and celebrating the first draft with a bottle of wine on his balcony. All with a woman who made him feel at ease, relaxed but also inspired him to be energized and full of life. In the years he’d known her through university, Sizzi never made him feel less of a person – yet he was in constant admiration for the way she not only bought out the best in people but her work ethic and ability to turn her size, age and culture into her greatest assets. Always falling short in his father’s estimation, Robert surrounded himself with incredible people and struggled with constant feelings of intimidation – but Sizzi never made him feel that way. 

Physically, intellectually, even emotionally; Robert was a moth to her flame and couldn’t wait to have her to himself for an entire weekend! 

Minutes had passed while he’d been thinking about her, a quick glance at his watch and Robert cursed. Now he had to hurry to get ready and leave so she wouldn’t be kept waiting outside. Pulling on his rugby shorts and training singlet, Robert knew the effect his body used to have on women, before he’d settled down with a mistake. 

It was only a date in his imagination, but Robert couldn’t help wondering whether Sizzi would react to him the way other women used to? He immediately chided himself – coming out of a toxic relationship – the last thing he needed was to make a fool of himself over the first girl who caught his eye. Too late to change into something else, he grabbed his keys and left. Racing through the city towards the university where Sizzi had scored an elusive one-bedroom residence as a scholarship student. 

Turning into her street, Robert should have been focusing on parked cars and looking for her apartment building but almost drove through a red light at the sight of a gorgeous girl up ahead. All thoughts of his ex and Sizzi faded as he took in the bright pink yoga top and fucking hot body that he’d love to wrap his arms and legs around. Robert smiled, feeling like a man again instead of a cheated on ex-boyfriend. In trying hard not to be seen checking out the girl, he almost drove past Sizzi’s building, Robert hit the brakes so hard his car squealed to a stop, getting the attention of the woman in pink. 

Sizzi! The woman he’d wanted to wrap himself around was the same woman whose lips he’d started fantasizing about kissing and whose mere presence invigorated him. Sizzi. Oh, he groaned, how much would he give to have this be a date instead of a study session.

“You know how to get my attention,” she smiled, opening the passenger door before he had a chance. 

“I could say the same about you,” he said, still not able to reconcile the idea that the sight of Sizzi from half-way down the street rendered him unable to stand. Fuck, where had she been hiding that body and how was he supposed to resist it and her?

“Ready to get hot and sweaty?” Even though he knew she was talking about their jog, it didn’t help with the uncomfortable bulge he hoped she didn’t notice.

“Bring it on. I assume you train?” Not that he wanted to think about her jogging around random streets in those pants. Man, he had to get a grip!

“The only thing that relieves my stress – from uni and work. What about you?”

“Fitness for rugby and stress from rowing.”

“Rowing is stressful?” Her beautiful forehead crinkled with confusion. “I would have thought that hours on the water would be therapeutic.”

“One Chinese rowing with a bunch of kangas!” Robert used the slang term for the white Australian boys that made up the rest of his team. “Out on the water, I’m one of them because they need me.”

“But you’ve never been invited out for a beer?”

“It’s not intentional, just that I don’t move in the same circles.”

“And of course, you’d be happier ‘with your own kind’,” Sizzi finished his thoughts.

“Exactly. How do you deal with it?” They were almost back at the beach and he didn’t want the conversation to end.

“I don’t,” she unexpectedly reached out and squeezed his spare hand, taking it away before he could squeeze back. If her skin hadn’t burned into his own, Robert would have thought the moment was all in his imagination. “I walk into a room with my bright pink hair, attitude and almost challenge the rest of the room to tell me I don’t belong.”

A sentiment he could appreciate, despite his father’s position and wealth. “It’s almost like we are here as invited guests and can be uninvited at any time.”

“I didn’t think you’d understand?” Her shock was genuine.

“Of course, I do, money doesn’t buy acceptance.”

“But it opens doors and makes sure you have a roof over your head.” Sizzi timed her comment for pulling into the basement of his penthouse apartment. He couldn’t argue about what money could buy – and she’d never understand about what it couldn’t. It couldn’t buy love, or acceptance or even respect. Things that mattered far more to him than the size of his trust fund.

“Do you want me to drop your bag upstairs, or do you want to come in first?” Not that he could be held responsible for what he wanted to do with Sizzi in that bloody outfit. Hell, he had never been more thankful for baggy shorts that could hide his thoughts.

“I’ll wait down here and stretch – can’t have you beating me!” she teased, not understanding the impact of his imagination.

Fuck. How on earth was he supposed to follow that ass? Robert jogged up the fire stairs just so he’d be warmed up enough to be in front. His physical comfort relied on him being able to set the pace! But he’d be willing to blame it on male ego – perhaps in time Sizzi would realize he cared more about others than he’d ever cared about himself. 

Yes, he thought, she’d realize, understand and even accept that’s the way he was.


Five kilometres into their run and while Robert tried to concentrate on anything other than Sizzi, it was bloody difficult. As his eyes followed her curves, he was filled with reproach for never noticing her as an incredibly sensual woman with everything a man could possibly want in a dynamic package. The fact that she was an experienced runner made it even harder, not only to keep up but when he fell behind, he had to follow her tight little ass which made breathing difficult, thinking impossible and running painful.

“Did you want to stop off and get a juice or something,” he panted as Sizzi collapsed next to him on the soft grass. Lying next to each other, sharing a juice was the only idea he had that was suitable for public viewing! He knew how to relieve his pain, but it wouldn’t be fair to pull her into the nearest bush and find out if she tasted as hot as she looked! Oh, the thought just made things even worse.

“Sure, why not,” she said before doing a dozen sit ups and without showing any signs of their run. Not even a sweat. 

“Stop showing off!” he warned, not wanting her to know what dark thoughts he’d been trying to hide for the last half an hour.

“Can’t you handle the pace,” she teased.

With more control than he felt, Robert replied, “I can handle anything you can throw at me.”

“Something I intend to remember.”

“Watch yourself!”

“What are you going to do about it – catch me?” Sizzi jumped up and took off before he could splutter a reply. By the time she stopped at a local juice bar, Robert was exhausted and exhilarated in equal measure. Who the hell was this woman and why hadn’t he realized who she was before? He racked his brain for an answer; they had hung out together so many times in the last year, yet it was only these last days that a curtain had been lifted from his eyes.

“You know,” he said, paying for the juices. “We could work just as well from a cafe over lunch as we could at my house?” The idea of sitting across from Sizzi, eating two or three courses over a couple of glasses of chardonnay was the best idea he’d had in months – and almost a date.

“I don’t think that I’m really dressed for anything more than a juice bar.” Her words said, “no” but could he sense a tinge of regret?

“Well did you bring any clothes with you?” Robert wasn’t ready to give up, yet.

“I did, but nothing too fancy.”

“Well,” he tried to hide his disappointment. “I guess we’re stuck at my place together.”

“There are worse things in life,” Sizzi softly admitted. Robert needed to know how far she would be willing to go, with him. After all, this wasn’t a date. 

Unless she wanted it to be? 

“Like what?” He could only hope.

“Like you’re about to be beaten by a girl twice in one day.” Without giving him any time to respond, Sizzi threw her empty cup in the trash and took off. Robert could only marvel at her energy and enthusiasm and oh my – everything he didn’t expect to feel.

By the time he caught up to her in the foyer of his apartment, Robert was trying not to think of her showering naked in his bathroom. He’d been so pathetically faithful that the idea of another woman showering in his home had never bothered him before. She and the volunteers had basically used his place as their base for the Festival. Most mornings he woke up to exhausted bodies across every flat surface. Why did the thought of her naked in his shower bother him now?

As she greeted him with a relaxed and triumphant smile, he knew.

He wanted to soap her back. He wanted to towel dry her hair and then twirl it around his fingers as he felt her spasm beneath him.

“Are you ready to come upstairs?” he asked, unlocking the front door.

“Absolutely – and I hope you’ve got shampoo with those spare towels!”

“It also comes with a full service, if you want,” he teased and then immediately realized what he said and the many possible interpretations. It was only a date in his mind. “Of course, towels, hair dryer, whatever you need. I’m sure I’ve got it,” he tried to recover.

“Again, something to think about.”

Despite everything he thought he knew about himself and love, something about this woman had exploded and now he couldn’t put it back into a bottle even if he tried. He wanted this woman to be more than just a friend and if she didn’t feel the same, he’d deal with that after they finished the report. He owed her that much. After all, it wasn’t really a date.

 

What had she been thinking? 

Robert was so unbelievably hot; his smooth and muscular body barely hidden by his work out gear. Sizzi regretted even the idea of going on a jog together. Standing in the elevator next to his glistening, sweaty limbs, all she wanted to do was rip off his shirt and see what he had underneath. It’s not as if it came as a shock, after all he rowed for the university and played football. He obviously worked out, but she’d never been standing next to him in a confined space after trying not to look at him for the last two hours. Striving to keep ahead of him just to stay in the running zone instead of being distracted by desires she had no right to have.

She’d never seen him look at her the way he’d been doing today. As if he was seeing her for the first time as a woman and not as either a friend or colleague. As much as she had prayed for this moment, Sizzi didn’t know how to cross the friend-zone. Not when Robert Zhang had meant so much to her for so long. His kindness, integrity, sense of humor – and of course the fact that his body could keep her satisfied for the rest of her life – well at least thinking about it would be the most she could hope for.

Riding together in the slowest elevator ever invented, the longer Robert looked at her with softened eyes, the less she wanted to look away. In a conversation all of their own, their eyes flickered but kept coming back together. Sizzi dared to hope that Robert was able to read her mind and liked what he saw. 

Nothing ventured, nothing gained, she thought. The moment his head slightly tilted with a smile to match his eyes, Sizzi took her chance – leaning, her lips lightly touching his until he moved into her body. Spinning her around against the elevator wall, their bodies melded as one. His reaction was more than she hoped for – like hungry animals they kissed, not even stopping when they reached his floor. Barely making it inside his apartment before Sizzi did what she’d wanted to do for months – pulling his shirt over his head before dramatically flinging it across the room. Kicking off their shoes without missing a beat as they shuffled through the apartment, lips still unwilling to disengage.

Not even allowing seconds in between kisses, Sizzi refused to give him time for second thoughts. The longer they kissed the more she felt his desire grow and felt more confident in throwing caution to the wind.

After all, if they were only ever going to be together once, she wanted it now and on her terms. Just once couldn’t hurt. No promises and no regrets. Regret was for tomorrow.

 

Oh, my! Talk about drowning in the richest of milk chocolate with just a touch of chili to spice things up! Robert didn’t expect Sizzi’s first kiss let alone for her to match his desire. All the passion and energy she gave to every other part of her life was laid in front of him to take.

Only, he wanted to give more than he received; give her more than she could ever expect.

Instead of taking her quickly with abandon and to hell with tomorrow, he wanted to build her slowly until they could explode together. He’d never wanted a woman in this way – but he’d never wanted a woman like Sizzi.

Unwilling to rip off her clothes, at least not until he had permission, he gently pulled off her crop top, exposing those beautiful breasts she’d kept hidden.

Suckling at the deep rose nipples until she pushed him further into his own home. The couch was closer, but Robert wanted to give Sizzi the comfort she deserved. Picking up her slight frame, he still struggled to carry her through to the bedroom, but since she had caused his discomfort, Robert hoped she’d also be the cure.

Their first time was going to be the last, first time in his life – if he could help it. Gliding inside Sizzi was exquisite, the whole feeling of drowning in molten chocolate the closest he could ever describe. Smooth, sweet and giving into an addiction he didn’t even know he had.

As she rolled back into his arms with her natural smile all for him, Robert couldn’t begin to thank her for curing him of any stupid heartbreak he thought he had. Kissing between her breasts, making his way up her neck, she cried, “Really? Again?”

“Only if you want to?” He hoped her insatiability matched her 

“Oh, I want to – but I’ll ask you again – can you handle me?” Those gorgeous lips teased.

“How about you set the pace and I’ll do my best to keep up.” It was the best he could offer after being shown up on their jog.

“If that’s the best you’ve got to offer!” Sizzi mocked, attempting to get out of bed but squealing in delight as he pulled her back.

“Never let it be said, I’m holding you here against your will.” He rolled on top, pinning her hands above her head. “Say the word and I’ll release you.”

“How about the only way you let me go is if I say, ‘Avocado,” she looked at him with trusting eyes. Hell, she didn’t even know how much he could want – or do.

“Our very own safe word?”

“Unless you can think of another one?”

“Where did you get ‘avocado’ from?” The last thing he wanted was conversation, but he’d had safe words before and never a fruit.

“I can’t think of a single conversation we could have naked that we’d be talking about an avocado.”

“Smart girl!”

“Really? That’s all you think of me?” Sizzi looked up at him with those teasing eyes, begging him to kiss them until they paled in contented desire.

“No more talking!” Robert silenced any further thoughts until her only sounds were satisfied purrs.


Robert didn’t expect anything from Sizzi – yet she was exquisite and beyond his wildest dreams. Fitting so neatly in his arms and his bed, Robert could easily imagine her becoming his partner in life. One magical afternoon of never getting out of bed and he was at risk of falling in love with this beautiful woman before admitting to the world he was well and truly over another one. 

When they weren’t making love, they could talk about anything and everything. Finding a shared passion for travel. “I hate going all touristy,” she admitted, not knowing how strongly he felt the same. “I’d rather explore the local villages and eat what they eat by the side of the road or some back-street café than a five-star dining experience. Not that you’d understand.”

“You couldn’t be more wrong. Don’t laugh, but I like watching local sporting matches – the smiles on kids’ faces as they play soccer or basketball. It doesn’t matter that I don’t know the teams or half the time understand the language. Its watching people be naturally joyful that’s part of the experience.”

“Experiencing life and emotions not just taking photos.”

“Exactly.”

Getting to know each other as more than friends, Robert couldn’t think of anyone else in the world he’d rather be with. How on earth had he gotten so lucky?

Turning to Sizzi, they lay facing each other and he took a little pride in the satisfied look on her face. She was beautiful. Robert drew his fingers from her cheek slowly down to her chin until she laughed, taking his fingers in small nibbles before he drew a wet line down her chest between her breasts then down to circle her belly button. 

“You are,” he started, only stopping when she curled up in a fit of giggles. “What?” he cried in mock indignation, after all he wanted to overwhelm her with accolades of desire.

“I am nothing – it’s ‘we are.’”

“What do you mean ‘we’?” he asked, leaning in to kiss those beautiful lips that he couldn’t get enough of. “By the way, I was going to say you are beautiful before you so rudely interrupted.”

“We are good together.”

“I couldn’t agree more, but …”

“No buts, unless it is naked and yours!” She pulled him closer, threatening to dissolve any thoughts of responsibilities.

“We still have that report to write unless you want to inspire me to greatness,” he said, his fingers following the curves of her body down to play with the ass that had made jogging so uncomfortable.

Smothering his face in kisses, Sizzi laughed, “I think I know how to inspire you but if you ever want further encouragement, just let me know.”

This time when he took her it was with a furious passion. She was so bubbly and full of life he wanted her essence to invade him. He’d been such a bloody fool, wasting time over a woman who was ambitious and cold instead of smart and generous. Deceitful instead of open and honest. Moody instead of brightness and light. 

Yes, one afternoon with Sizzi and not only had he moved on; his heart was already being lost to a woman who deserved it. Sizzi was so much more than Jade had ever been. “Sizzi. Sizzi. Sizzi,” he cried. With Sizzi in his life, he couldn’t believe how much time had been wasted with Jade. Not when Sizzi had been there waiting for him to open his eyes.

Only when she came, and begged him to do the same, did Robert make his greatest mistake. In silent congratulation of having come to his senses and looking forward to building something amazing with Sizzi; thrilled to be moving on from his past and in the throes of passion, Robert said the one name to destroy it all, “Jade.”



Sizzi jumped up in a flash, her face stricken with hurt, grief and rage in equal measures. 

“No – no – no! I didn’t mean it. I promise I didn’t mean that!” Robert cried, wishing the heavens would open, strike him down and take away her pain.

“You … you said it,” her cries were of a wounded animal.

“No, no not the way you think,” he stumbled, unable to find the words. How could he be such a bloody idiot. “Sizzi, please wait!” he cried as she darted from his bed, snatching up her clothes. Shoving whatever she couldn’t put on quickly into her bag, Robert needed her to stop, grabbing her arm, trying to hold her while she shook her head, pushing him away. “Please, please, please. I need you to hear me.”

“Why?” she cried but at least she stopped moving towards the door. 

Robert had seconds to turn this around before he lost Sizzi because of an unforgiveable misunderstanding. “You need to know the truth.”

“I think I heard the truth.” Her chest heaved from silent sobs.

“No – you heard one word. You didn’t hear what’s in my heart.” He chanced to pull her closer, unwilling to lose Sizzi now – not when she’d opened his eyes to what could be perfect.

“Oh, no!” she pushed him away again. “I think we all saw your heart on full display. I just thought,” she stuttered while a single tear fell down her cheek. 

“Please let me explain,” Robert said, wiping the tear away.

“No.”

“We’ve still got that report to write,” he tried to appeal to her sense of responsibility.

“I don’t care.”

“We both know that’s not true. Please, if you need time before you hear me out then let’s smash out that report.” Her head fell to hide more tears, and Robert gently lifted her chin – grateful she didn’t flinch at his touch. If she didn’t leave, there was still hope. “I tell you what, I promise to write the whole bloody thing myself if you want me to – just give me a chance to explain.”

 

Sizzi didn’t have a choice. Her future career and possibly any future business connections relied on this report being able to open doors. She couldn’t pull it together on her own, Robert knew how to pitch this sort of paper so that next year’s festival be an easy decision for sponsors. 

He’d already set them up in the small office off to the side of the living areas but Sizzi couldn’t bring herself to sit in a confined space with the man who had so readily smashed her heart. Yes, when they first started kissing, she had no expectations. But then he had to go and make her feel as if what they were sharing was the beginning of something special.

Even if he hadn’t expected today to lead somewhere, what sort of an asshole cries out another woman’s name?

Without asking, Sizzi moved the laptop and papers into the main dining room where she could put space between their work and the man. 

Robert pulled his chair around to join her, “It doesn’t have to be like this.” He sounded so sincere that if it had been any other word, she’d want to believe him. “Please, I’m begging you, let me explain.”

“We have a report to write.” She couldn’t even think about how stupid she’d been thinking that going for a jog with Robert could possibly be a good idea. Of course, it would end up with her kissing him – not that he had a choice but to respond. She’d done everything to get them into bed and now, somehow, they needed to work together as if it never happened.

Foolish girl!

What she needed, was to go on a long jog on her own. Clear her mind from impossible dreams and remember that Robert’s heart could never be hers – that they would never be more than friends or colleagues.

Unable to sit still, Robert stood, watching her for any sign. Not that she could look him in the eye – what would be worse – pity or guilt? 

Silly, silly girl. She’d have the rest of her life to regret throwing herself at a man without thinking of the consequences. 

After a sigh, he disappeared into the kitchen to return with a pot of steaming jasmine tea and a half-eaten packet of chocolate chip cookies. “I’m sorry, I should have been more prepared for lunch,” he offered apologetically. 

“I’m not hungry.” Still, she accepted a cup of the tea until her shaking hands forced her to set it aside.

“Please let me explain.” He tried to hold her hand until she brushed it away.

“You’re really not going to let me start working on this report until you get it off your chest, are you?” she sighed, resigned to hearing how he had to say that name. 

“You know how I felt about Jade,” he started. Each word cutting her heart into smaller shards. 

“You didn’t make it a secret,” Sizzi snapped.

“When it ended, the way it ended, I was devastated. I had given her everything that I thought she wanted and …”

Sizzi looked away, needing him to stop talking about his ex-girlfriend while she could still feel him all over her. “Do you know how offensive it is to hear you talk about her? To have you say her name after what we just did? Have you any idea?”

“Please,” he said. “I’m so sorry.”

“At first, I thought we could see where one kiss could go – I know I started it and it’s all my fault,” she couldn’t hold back the sobs. 

“I never thought …” 

“Well, neither did I. If we’d stopped after the first time, then we could have laughed about some sort of friends with benefit.”

“I want more than that.”

“No – you don’t!” she cried again. “What I’m trying to say is that the more we were together, the more I trusted you and believed that you could want me as much as I cared about you.”

“I’m sorry for saying that one stupid word – but I promise you that all I’ve wanted to do all day was kiss you. You didn’t start anything that I didn’t want.”

“Except you didn’t want it with me.” Her voice broke as she finally tried to meet his eyes. “Her, not me.”

“I promise that the only woman I’ve been thinking of since the restaurant – is you. When I saw you there today, all I wanted to do was grab you and kiss you like you’ve never been kissed before.”

“Why didn’t you?”

“I want more than just to hook up. Come on, Sizzi! You must have felt what we had back there?”

“You mean right up until you said her name?”

“I’m so sorry that happened – I’d never lead you on if I didn’t mean it.”

“Consider me not only lead on, but also let down.”

 

For the rest of the weekend. Robert worked on the report while Sizzi fed him ideas and pretended that the hours in bed never happened. 

Yes, he had been a fucking idiot and deserved to spend time in the romance penalty box, but he couldn’t stay there forever – and one the report was done, Sizzi would never have a reason to be anywhere near him again. The report became a metaphor for their relationship – torture to write and even more painful to finish because of what might come next.

“I’m sorry.”

“I heard you.”

“Do you believe me?” 

“Yes.” 

He could have felt believed, if she didn’t spend the Saturday night curled up on the sofa pretending to read through her notes. Still, he’d never worked so easily with another person and by midnight on Sunday, they finally had a first draft.

“I didn’t think we’d get it done,” he admitted as the pages spewed out of the printer.

“We promised the others.”

“We still need to talk.” Not that he could say anything that he hadn’t reiterated before.

“I’d better go home.” With a yawn, Sizzi started to pack up her things. 

Robert handed her the printed copies, wanting to at least brush her fingers but she was too clever to let him come close. Damn it, he had apologized and given her space all day to forgive him. What if she walked out the door and never gave him another chance?

What if he didn’t deserve it – or her?

He’d sat too long, frozen by indecision but when Sizzi reached his front door without even a word, Robert rushed to her, clasping her hand over the door-handle. “Please don’t go,” he pleaded.

“Why would I want to stay?” He chose to believe Sizzi wanted him to convince her.

“Because if you walk out that door, you’ll never know which part of my heart to believe.”

“I think you made it pretty clear when you said her name.”

“I know you believe that but if you don’t stay – if you don’t give us a chance – you’ll never know whether everything else I said is also real.” He chanced to kiss the back of her neck, “You’ll only ever look back on this night and wonder what if?” Her head bowed as he kissed her exposed neck again, dropping his hand to her hips and wishing she’d turn around.

After the longest pause, Sizzi said so softly he almost made the mistake of asking her to repeat it, “If you knew how I feel about you, how could you have been so cruel?”

Watching every twitch or slightest movement, as soon as her body swayed ever so slightly towards him, Robert took his chance. With firm hands, he cupped her waist and spun her around until she faced him, his arms holding her as close as he dared. “Stay the night. Sleep in my bed or in one of the spare rooms, but please, give me the chance to make this right for you.”

She seemed torn between running away and never seeing him again or being convinced to stay. “It’s late, please just stay the night.” Robert tried to appeal to her logic, “You’ve been yawning for the last hour; it’s too late for you to go home; and at least here you’ll be safe. Tomorrow morning I’ll make you breakfast take you back to your place with heaps of time to get to our meeting with the others.”

Wordlessly and almost in a trance, Sizzi accepted his kisses, her hand still his inside not making any attempt to let go. Only when he led her towards his bedroom, she stopped. “I can’t. I want to believe you – but I can’t. Not tonight.”

With the deepest sigh, Robert settled her into his main guest bedroom. The one he always had made up in case his parents sprung a visit from China. It had the softest sheets and pillows and the best mattress his father could afford - perfect for the perfect woman even if he couldn’t share it.

“If you need anything, you know where I am.”

At least, she allowed him one more kiss. Their lips touching with all the emotion of their heart without the passion from before. The saddest of kisses that might as well have been, “good-bye” instead of “good night.” Then, before he could try to end the night another way, Sizzi closed the bedroom door, leaving him alone with his mountain of regret.

 

Sizzi couldn’t remember when she first started to love Robert – but she wanted to believe that everything until he said her name had been real. Every part of her wanted to believe that he hadn’t been thinking of Jade while making love to her. Unable to sleep last night, she’d replayed the moment until she could almost recreate his inflections.

Resisting his apologies all day, she should have gone home hours ago. Sizzi’s body craved Robert, too tormented to sleep knowing he was only metres away. Lying awake wanting more than anything to be in his arms but knowing she deserved better. She knew she deserved better, but the heart wanted what the heart wanted – and despite what she’d heard, her heart wanted to believe.

By two am, giving up on sleep, Sizzi crept to the kitchen, looking for milk or water, juice or anything that could help. Focused on looking through the refrigerator and marveling at how domesticated Robert’s kitchen was for a single man, she didn’t hear him until he appeared over her shoulder. His familiar, gentle hand on her hip, fingertips playing with the bottom of her t-shirt. “I couldn’t sleep either, not while you’re in my home and not in my bed.”

“You hurt me.” She didn’t know what else to say, after all it was the truth and neither of them could do anything about it. 

“Come to bed and let me hold you until you fall asleep.”

“And then what?” she sighed. 

“Tomorrow, we’ll go back to whatever you want to be.” He looked at her with those big brown eyes she loved. “We can be friends, lovers – or anything you want. But tonight, please? Let me be the one to help you sleep.”

Despite all her head screaming “No! What are you doing!” Sizzi allowed him to lead her by the fingertips back to his bedroom. She curled up on the edge of the bed, only for him to pull her closer to the middle. “I won’t let you fall,” he whispered, making more room for her. Still, Sizzi fell asleep within minutes of closing her eyes, spooned in his arms.

Never had her dreams been so vividly filled by the man in her bed.

Never had the hurt been so great. She could hear him call out her name in desire, but each time she went to reach for him, the name changed, and her dream faded to black.

The rising sun streaming through his window woke Sizzi to see Robert lying face down on the bed. His boxer shorts barely covered by the sheet. One kiss and she knew he’d turn to her and they could pretend … they could pretend what? That he’d never loved another? That he hadn’t been thinking of her when making love to Sizzi?

All her tormented thoughts returned – what part of yesterday had been a dream? Was it how he looked at or made love to her? Or was it defined in a single moment? Robert didn’t stir when she quietly and carefully rolled away from him and out of bed. Within half an hour she had caught a bus back home and within an hour she pretended not to be surprised when Robert joined her and the others at their coffee shop. Being the first to arrive, Sizzi already handed out copies of the draft report and the team were already well and truly in editing mode.

“You guys are the dynamic duo,” Jay applauded them. “We should get you guys to work together more often.”

“He’s right,” Bae agreed. “This stuff is amazing! How did you get this done in one weekend?”

Sizzi laughed, “It was easy without other distractions.” She watched Robert wince, so obvious he wanted to get her alone and talk. But Sizzi needed time away from being in the same room, house or even city as Robert so she could think straight and decide logically and based on some sort of evidence rather than her twisted heart. Until then, his words were wasted. 

As they gathered up all the scrawled comments, Robert threw out as much for her ears as the others, “I’ve got classes until late tonight.”

Sizzi shrugged, resigned to finishing the report alone.

“But, if you’re up for a late night, I’ll feed you and we can go through the changes and get another version to the team tomorrow.”

Sizzi had to laugh – he had just perfectly stitched her up. “You don’t have to – I can do the changes,” she suggested, wondering what he’d do.

Robert’s laugh matched her own, without any sense of the stress that being together but not together would create, “Actually, most of the changes are in my sections. I don’t want to go rogue and since I missed out on some of this conversation, I think everyone would feel more comfortable if we work on it together.”

Challenge accepted – she could work with him one more night. “Fine! What time?”

“Well, my last class finishes at seven,” Robert responded as calmly as ordering a pizza. “I can pick you up from your place on my way home?”

“Fine.” Sizzi gathered her things and headed off before she could either change her mind or Robert could walk with her to their shared class. Instead of taking her usual seat, she made her way to the far side of the lecture theatre. She’d already settled by the time he appeared at the doorway, ignoring his friends to look for her. He didn’t mask the joy when he caught her eye – perhaps he did genuinely want to make this right because he cared and not out of guilt? Still, she needed to know that this was more than a rebound.

The rest of the day passed in a blur between classes and tutoring a handful of rich first year students. By the time she got back to her unit it was almost half past six. Exhausted, she didn’t have the energy for dealing with her emotions tonight. As much as she didn’t trust herself to cancel, Sizzi pulled out her phone to tell Robert to make whatever changes he wanted to – she didn’t care anymore – only to open the door to his insistent knocking.

“I thought you said you didn’t do the whole parking?” How was it that he looked refreshed and so damn fuckable while she felt like a wrung out, second-hand tissue.

“I might not do parking, but I do know when someone is about to avoid me.” He smiled, “How soon before you’re about to send me a text message?”

“What do you mean?” Sizzi could hide her phone but not her smile.

“I know you well enough to know you were about to tell me that it’s been a big day, that you’re tired and that you’re happy for me to do all the work on my own.”

“Well, as you said, all the work is in the sections you wrote – what would I have to contribute?” 

“Everything.”


Making love to Robert that night set a pattern she couldn’t – and didn’t want to – escape. By day they were barely speaking and not even friends, but by the middle of the night, Sizzi couldn’t help herself. Turning up to Robert’s apartment, unannounced for one kiss. Only for him to pull her inside, asking for no explanations and giving her nothing to regret. 

“I don’t know why.” Her only excuse before becoming putty in his arms, and hands and bed. Allowing him to make love to her, giving herself with complete honesty in the moment – but as soon as it was over, she needed to leave his bed.

“Babe?” The first night, he’d convinced her to stay in the spare bedroom and by the end of the week it had become her own. Not that she stayed the whole night, always leaving before Robert woke for rowing practice. 

If only she knew what to believe – her body or his heart?

 

“What the hell is going on with you two?” Jay asked Robert.

“What do you mean?”

“Sizzi, man. I can’t believe the woman was hot for you for months and now acts as if you are the bloody devil.”

“Leave it alone.”

“Why? Are you telling me that getting to know you wasn’t necessarily a good thing?”

He cut Jay off with some weak excuse of needing to go back and catch up with one of his lecturers. Robert had no fucking idea what was going on with Sizzi. Almost every night, she came to him willingly and believed in their love, but by daylight his single word came back to haunt them.

Robert didn’t know how to turn things around. It had been two weeks now and he and Sizzi had fallen into a pattern that most men would die for – but he couldn’t just pretend to be happy with a relationship that was only sexual. The first night, she’d come back, and they’d finished off the report. He had been fully prepared to drop her back home, but when she kissed him, it didn’t take a rocket scientist to know they’d end up in bed.

Until it was over, and then the best he could do was convince her to stay in the spare room.

The second night, he made sure she felt the full power of his love. Holding back on his own satisfaction to smother her in loving. Until, yet again, she retreated to his spare room.

For whatever reason, Sizzi turned up at his doorstep late at night, without warning and without explanation. No matter how hard he tried, she didn’t want conversation, only sex. Even when he finally convinced her to fall asleep in his arms, she left before he woke in the morning. 

Robert craved the emotional connection from that first Saturday. When life and love seemed possible and the only challenge would be how quickly could he introduce her to the world as his girlfriend and partner.

It wasn’t even as if he could get advice from someone, not even Jay who knew them both.

After all he was living the male dream - sex without commitment. The stress of loving a woman who refused to forgive him but was willing to come to him every night was more than he could bear. Robert couldn’t remember eating – unless it was a breakfast he’d made for the two of them. Sleeping was sporadic. Even when she was in his arms, he lay awake half the night in dread that if he fell asleep, she’d be gone.

This couldn’t go on much longer – it wasn’t fair to either of them. Either he could prove to Sizzi that what they had was too special to lose over one stupid mistake – or he had to be strong enough to walk away to let them both grieve and move on. Could he love her enough to want her to be happy without him? 

Only if he’d tried everything first to save what they had. 

 

Sizzi couldn’t keep doing this to herself; waking in Robert’s bed not meaning to have spent the night but unable to help herself.

She’d arrived closer to ten pm - parking in his visitor car spot as she had done most nights over the last couple of weeks. By now, their routine was almost set in stone. Robert opened the door and had tried to hold her off from kissing him, wanting to talk. A moment of struggle that he lost as soon as their lips touched. Feeling him weaken and ready to give into her desire, Sizzi could remove his clothes, take control and quickly feel as close physically as she wished they could be emotionally. She craved his body, the feel of it next to and inside her. Those moments when she could forget what had happened and live in the moment. Pretending that their connection could last longer than the sex.

Even though she didn’t need to flee his bed immediately, as soon as Robert tried to talk, beg for another chance to explain or did anything that would mean opening her heart instead of her body, Sizzi left. 

Last night, he’d let his eyes do all the talking, gently caressing her face while his deep brown eyes said everything she wanted to hear. Only once did he take a deep breath as if to speak, resisting at the slight shake of her head. He shouldn’t even bother trying to talk by now, but in the deep reassesses of her heart, Sizzi held onto a sliver of hope that one day she could let go of the hurt. For now, it had been enough to fall asleep to the stroke of his hand and feeling the love from his eyes.

Did she have time for a shower before going home, she thought? By now, her shampoo hung in his shower, her toothpaste and a toothbrush had been set aside for her and he even stocked her favorite strength coffee pods for his machine. Little by little, Robert had made his home hers, even if it was only for hours at a time.

“Please don’t,” Robert called from the bed as she swung her legs onto the floor, breaking the mood from last night. Sizzi didn’t even look around or try to respond – the only time she spoke to him was when other people were around to protect the façade of friendship.

“Sizzi please.” He lightly held her wrist, stopping her from leaving.

“What could you possibly say?”

“How about, that I’m falling in love with you but you’re not making it easy.”

She couldn’t hear those words – not when he couldn’t possibly mean them. “Why the bloody hell should I make it easy on you?”

“Either you want this between us, or you don’t.” 

“Who says I want anything at all from you?” How she wished that she didn’t.

“I think the fact that you keep turning up here each night means that you want something.”

“And when it’s over, I leave.”

“Babe, you are amazing, sexy and as much as it kills me to say it, I’m pretty sure that you could get laid anytime you want to, it wouldn’t have to be just me.”

“Don’t worry, I won’t make this mistake again.” 

All her fears had come true – conversation would only end whatever this thing was that held them together. She had to get away. By now, Sizzi was expert at dressing quickly and leaving but this time Robert fought her to get to the front door first.

“Please, don’t go.” He tried the soft caresses that meant so much last night, but this morning had to be shallow and fake, didn’t they? “I didn’t mean what I said.”

“Mean what?” she cried. “That you think you’re falling in love with me? Or that you called out another woman’s name? I mean, what crap that comes out of your mouth should I believe, and what part should I ignore?”

“That’s not fair.”

“Look, I thought it was far better neither of us talk. I turn up, we kiss, we fuck and then life goes back to normal.”

“I want more than that. You deserve more than that.” This time she brushed away his hand, feeling the end coming and unable to stop it.

“I know I bloody well deserve more than that but since I’m not going to get it from you, if you want to call an end to this thing between us, then don’t worry, I won’t bother your doorstep again.” The tears would come if she didn’t immediately escape from this place that could only ever remind him of her and would only ever be the bed from where he called out her name. 

Sizzi forced down the tears – surely, they could wait another couple of minutes before unleashing in all the love she could never show him. As firmly as she could muster, “Get out of my way.”

He refused to move away from the door, “No, I can’t do that.”

“Get out of my way.” Embarrassed, her tears fell freely only to be wiped away by the man who caused each one. “I need to get out of here.”

“At least let me give you a lift home.”

“Don’t bother - I’ve got my car here.”

“Well at least let me make you breakfast, your favorite coffee, or let me do something.”

“Don’t bother.”

“Sizzi would you just let me bloody well do something for you?”

“How about you forget I even existed.”

Sizzi ran through the hallway; wishing that hitting the button harder would make the elevator come quicker. Wishing that Robert would follow her and make one last ditch attempt to save whatever he thought they had together. Instead, there was just the burring of the elevator arriving.

 

_I need your help._

Robert couldn’t stop Sizzi from leaving any more than he could resist her if she turned up again. Not that he had any confidence their midnight rendezvous would continue after this morning’s outburst. Why couldn’t she see that their relationship had to be more than sex? But the risk of never seeing her again was inconceivable.

He needed to do something so grand that she couldn’t ignore; something that would break down her lack of trust in him and them.

_I don’t think so._

In desperation, Robert reached out to Sizzi’s closest friend, Bae who had helped organize the Festival and had watched their relationship disintegrate.

_Half an hour, please?_

_Fifteen minutes or as long as it takes for me to drink my coffee._

“Thanks for hearing me out.” An hour later, Robert handed over the requisite coffee and pleaded his case.

“That day in the restaurant, everything started to click into place. Until then, I’d never noticed Sizzi as more than a friend, but once I started thinking about all the things I admired about her, I couldn’t stop. I know she didn’t think that picking her up for a jog was a date…”

“She wanted to,” Bae interrupted. “She kept trying to convince herself that the weekend together wasn’t a date, but when you turned up early to go jogging, it set all her hopes on fire.”

“I had no idea. The point is, I’m driving down the street and I see this gorgeous girl up ahead and I think, great, I’m ready to move on, but when I realized that it was Sizzi …” his voice trailed off. “I need to make this right. If we break up, I want it to be because we’re not good together or because there is something major that we can’t agree on – not this.”

“Seriously, what did you expect? Sizzi crushed on you for a year and then you go and say that?” Bai wasn’t about to let him off lightly.

“It wasn’t like that, I promise. I’d been going through all the things about Jade that annoyed me –comparing her to Sizzi – and then wondering what I ever saw in Jade when I had someone perfect in front of me all that time. To me, in every way that matters, Sizzi is perfect. She thinks about other people; she’s smart and funny,” Robert warmed to his favorite theme. “I love the way that she has a way about her that doesn’t make other people feel insignificant or unworthy by being around them. I love being around her and I want more than just the nights together. I want a whole life.”

“Why don’t you just tell her that?” Bai asked and Robert saw his chance to prove himself.

“I’ve tried, believe me, I’ve tried; but it’s as if the moment I said Jade’s name Sizzi stopped listening to anything else I had to say.

“I don’t think I can help you.”

“Look,” Robert didn’t want to tell anyone about his idea before it all came together, but he knew that he needed help. “I’ve invited my parents to Australia because I want them to meet the woman I want to marry.”

“Wa!” Bae switched to native Chinese. “Are you really that serious?”

“Absolutely.”

“Does Sizzi have any idea?”

“She would if she would only let me tell her – you have no idea how stubborn she can be.”

“Oh, I think I do,” Bae laughed, her coffee cup empty but at least she hadn’t left. “The two of you aren’t even dating, why on earth would she agree to marry you?”

“Because we want the same things out of life, we have the same values, she makes me laugh and I hope that I can make her happy.”

“But marriage?”

“Believe me, I never thought about marrying anyone else.”

“But you and Jade were living together - didn’t the subject come up?”

“Yes, but there was always a ‘maybe one day’ kind of thing. Not once did I ever want to ask the question or buy her a ring.”

“From what I heard; your father loved Jade.”

“My father could see the political advantage and while I would probably do a lot to get my father’s respect, when it comes to love, it’s Sizzi I want in my life - for the rest of my life.” He’d never said the words aloud, but they sounded perfect and right. If only Sizzi would let him say them to her.

He held Bae’s gaze, despite his impatience, he had to give her enough space to trust him. Eventually, she offered, “What do you want me to do?”

“I’ve organized a dinner to thank the sponsors for their support. Father has agreed to pay, and my parents will host. Do whatever it takes to make sure that Sizzi comes - I want her at the head of the table.”

“What will that do?”

Robert couldn’t believe Bae didn’t understand, “Whether she accepts me or not, she deserves the recognition. Whether you believe me or not, when Jade and I were destroying each other, it was Sizzi who kept the Festival together. My gift to her – even if she never forgives me – is to have the recognition and respect from the community.”

“So, what are you going to do”

Robert laughed at unveiling the part where it could all fall apart. “I’m going to do what any good Asian boy does - ask my mother to make herself known to the woman I love and plead my case.”

“Your mother? That’s a huge step. What if she doesn’t like Sizzi?”

“Then I’ll have one more challenge to get over – but what’s not to love about Sizzi? I’ve already spoken to my mother and she’s ready to meet Sizzi and if the opportunity presents, she’ll tell Sizzi how I feel. Surely, any Chinese girl knows that a boy will only tell his mother if he’s serious.”

“You’re taking a substantial risk - are you sure Sizzi is worth it?”

“It’s the only thing I’m sure of. After this morning, Sizzi is no longer taking my calls and apparently the night visits are over.”

Robert couldn’t say anything else to plead his case, all he could do was wait for Bae to finish studying him. “What makes you think she still cares?”

“If she didn’t care, she wouldn’t be so hurt - but you know Sizzi, tell me that I’m wrong.”

“You’re not wrong, but what if in front of all those people, she turns you down again.”

“Then it will be yet another public humiliation and disappointment my parents can hang over my head for the rest of my life.”

“Why would you do that?”

“Haven’t you heard a thing I’ve said,” Robert cried, feeling that his only chance was slipping away. If Bae didn’t make sure Sizzi turned up, he was out of ideas. “I love the woman.”

 

_Sizzi Yang_
_Mr. and Mrs. Zhang would like the pleasure of your company as they thank the sponsors and organizers of the Cultural Festival._

Sizzi didn’t expect a dinner or the invitation. One by one she rang the other Festival organizers who had all gotten the same invitation and were equally in the dark. 

“Did you see what was on the other side?” Jay asked.

“The list of sponsors,” she sighed. “I checked them off the master list. They are all there.”

“Forget the sponsors – almost all the organizers are named. Congrats - you got top billing.”

She tried to ignore the embossed card, but it screamed at her from the table, and burned in her handbag. 

“What do you think of this?” she asked Bae over breakfast the day before the dinner. She hadn’t RSVP’d but then again, did she have to?

“Looks impressive, the food should be great, and it can’t hurt to be on first name basis when job interviews come around.”

“I know, but …”

“What are you afraid of – seeing Robert dressed up in a suit and not being able to control yourself?” Bae oozed more enthusiasm for the dinner than the butterflies inside Sizzi could stomach.

“There’s a name missing.”

“Do you care?”

“It’s not whether I care that’s the problem.”

“I know that you don’t want to hear it, but if Robert Zhang, son of our hosts, still cared about her, he wouldn’t be doing this for you.”

“I haven’t said I’ll go,” she admitted, hoping Bae would help change her mind.

“Why the hell not!”

“His family will be there,” Sizzi didn’t want to admit how terrified she was of meeting Robert’s parents.

“Don’t you want to meet Robert’s father?”

“Last time he was here. I wanted to meet him and show him how right I’d be if Robert ever noticed me but it’s too late now.”

“Why is it too late?”

“It just is, I can’t go.” Her first instincts were right, and she firmed with her decision, “I’m not going.”

“No! You have to!” Bae cried.

“What’s the point?” Sizzi tried to explain. “He broke my heart once. Why should I give him a chance to do it all again?”

“Have you ever thought that maybe he does actually love you?” Bae pressed as Sizzi hoped she would, but still the fear remained.

“I wish that were true, but he doesn’t believe in loving anyone other than himself and Jade.”

“Well, he’s going out of his mind trying to prove differently.”

“He loves Jade.” No matter how many times she thought or said the words, they still cut as finely and deeply as the first. “He loved Jade before we got together, he loved her when we were making love and after I tried to hope he could feel that way about me, he called out her name while I was naked in his arms.”

“Did he ever explain.”

“He tried, but what’s the point?”

“What would it take him to actually convince you that he is over his ex?”

“A hell of a lot then just fucking me.”

“I thought he tried conversation and even dating, but you weren’t interested.” Bae knew her too well.

“I did try.”

“Really? Yet all those times when you went over to his house; you slept with him and went home; all those times was him using you for sex?”

“No.”

“Did he ever want you to stay?”

“Of course, he did.”

“Did he ever try and get you to talk?”

“Of course, he did.” 

Bae finally had gotten through as Sizzi hoped she would, but what if it was all too late? “Oh my, what have I done?” she cried, pushing away her untouched plate.

“When was the last time he reached out to you?

“About a week ago … I don’t know.” Panicked, she flicked through her phone, trying to look for evidence that he hadn’t given up. Nothing. 

“Look, how about you turn up to this thing that his parents are organizing and talk to him.” Bae hesitated before continuing, “I don’t think the way he feels about you is in question, but the dinner will give you a chance to see whether or not you feel the same.” 

Had her best friend seen through to her other, secret fear, “What do you mean?”

“Is it possible that you only liked Robert when he wasn’t in love with you. But now that he does, you’ve gone cold but are using what he said as an excuse?”

“I’m not like that.” Or at least she didn’t want to be.

“Then tell me, what is it about Robert that you are attracted to other than the fact that you couldn’t have him.”
Questions that Sizzi had avoided in case they gave her an inconvenient truth, but as soon as she closed her eyes to think of Robert, she saw his smile. When he smiled, it felt like he was only ever smiling for her. When he spoke, she ached to hear what else he had to say and then there was him, the way he looked at her when he thrust inside as if she was the only person in the world for him in that moment.

None of the reasons why she loved him would make sense to Bae or anyone, other than Robert. “I know, we want the same things out of life; we have the same values; he makes me laugh. He makes me feel energized. When I think about life with him, all I can feel is an overwhelming happiness.”

“And when you think of life without him?”

“There is a blackness, an empty hole.” She looked to Bae, her heart heavy with pain, “I’ve tried so hard, but I can’t not love him.”

“He says exactly the same thing about you, almost word for word.”

“Why, when did he talk to you?”

Ignoring her question, Bae held her hands and waited until Sizzi looked up, ready to hear what Bae had to say. “For once in your life, don’t think about it. Just feel and if it feels right, go for it, but if it doesn’t feel right you can always walk away. Don’t die wondering?”

“What else did he say?”

“It’s not what he said, it’s what he’s planning to do.”

“What, at the function?”

“All I can say is that you should make up your mind before you go and dress accordingly. Do you want to work things out or not?”

Sizzi hugged her friend before leaving the table - damn it! Why did love need to be so bloody complicated and why did the love of her life have to come with an ex?

“Did you see whose name isn’t on the list,” Jay asked, joining her at the cafe. She needed a male perspective and Jay never turned down a free coffee.

“Yeah, I was wondering if it was deliberate or intentional?” As one of Robert’s closest friends, Sizzi hoped Jay would have an inside scoop.

“Completely deliberate from what I heard - she’s been completely cut from anything to do with the Association, any of the minutes, any of the working documents her name has been stripped from wherever possible.”

“What about the public statement that went out - she lost her job over it.”

“Yeah - losing her job was the wife’s revenge. This is Robert’s. No good deed deserves to go unpunished, after all.” Jay could at least laugh.

“So, what do you make of it all?”

“Look, you know my feelings. Robert fell, fell hard and the crash came just as quick. This slow burn thing with the two of you - anyone could see that you two would find each other. I don’t know what went down, but my friend is hurting, and you don’t look happy now it’s over.”

“What should I do?”

“It depends - he’s told you often enough how he feels about you - do you believe him or not?”

“I want to.”

“Then you have your answer.”


No matter whether the dresses were hanging in her wardrobe, on the back of her door or laid carefully over her bed, Sizzi couldn’t decide which one would send the right message to Robert. Then again, she didn’t know what message she wanted to send.

She had loved him for so long, that if she turned up dressed for Robert and he rejected her, it would all have been for nothing. 

The Festival, putting aside her jealousies because the Festival had been important to Robert.

Every night she had turned to him, giving her body in all the ways she denied her heart. 

Every single dream and fantasy, without Robert, they’d be all for nothing.

If she turned up tonight, willing to try again, what if he searched his heart and found it wanting? Sizzi didn’t know how she’d find the strength to live in the same city, let alone finish at the same university.

The flee instinct is strong in this one, she thought to herself, trying to smile at the paraphrasing humor. Something that Robert would have appreciated, if only he was here. Or only if she had stuck around to listen to what he had to say.

The black satin gown draped through her fingers. Soft and sensual, the princess line design fit elegantly against her slim frame. If she wore her hair up, it would be perfect for the other guests and set her up for any introductions that could lead to graduate position interviews later. 

Except, she didn’t want a job - she wanted Robert to notice her, remember how they felt together and decide that they were worth a second chance.

The bright pink mini dress with the long skirt overlay was the opposite of the black. Modern, funky and made an entrance. Short enough to show off her legs and fitted in all the places that mattered. Perfect for getting Robert’s attention, but not necessarily for impressing his parents – or future employers.

The shower ran out of hot water before Sizzi had decided on her hair, makeup or dress. Wrapping her wet hair in a towel, she applied a light foundation and almost natural eye make-up. As much as she wanted Robert to sweep her off her feet at the dinner, the dress wouldn’t make a difference. She would love him in sweaty track pant, a suit or nothing at all - and hopefully he felt the same.

Sizzi dried her hair and then slipped into the black gown. Only when she sat on her bed to put her shoes on, did the tight skirt give her an idea.

Quickly, she pulled out the sewing box from the back of her closet - the one thing she promised her mother she’d never have to use - finding the tiny scissors and undoing the right front seam. Sizzi undid small sections, standing to check out her reflection. It needed to be past her knee, but not too high. Enough for Robert to want to run his fingers up her leg, but not enough for other guests to draw the wrong conclusions.

Sealing the seams with iron on tape, Sizzi sighed at the time. Instead of arriving early and meeting her friends to walk in as a group, she wouldn’t even be fashionably late unless there was a taxi waiting in the rank around the corner.

Half-way to the elevator, she turned for one more adjustment. Instead of the classic black sandals, Sizzi swapped them for the bright pink shoes that matched the other dress - and her hair. A little bit of color to remind herself of who she was - whatever Robert decided. She was Sizzi and could walk in and own any damn room she wanted.

So focused on getting to the taxi rank, Sizzi didn’t take any notice of the limousine parked outside her building. Until the chauffeur opened the back door and Robert stepped out, blocking her path.

“I was starting to get worried?” He looked as nervous as she felt.

“Why?” Not the first question that came to mind, but at least they were talking.

“I thought either you’d gotten changed somewhere else and I’d missed you –” 

“Or?”

“Or you decided you couldn’t bear to spend another evening with me, even if we are surrounded by friends.”

“I’m so sorry.” Sizzi wanted to run into his arms but needed a sign she’d be welcome.

“You’ve got nothing to be sorry for.”

“I never gave you a chance to explain, and when you tried, I didn’t listen.”

“The dinner, the night, it’s all for you.” 

Finally, he stepped forward and took her hand. Sizzi wanted so much more. “I don’t want limousines or fancy dinner parties.”

“You say that, but how else can I make you understand that I’m in love with you.” His gorgeous eyes gave her all the assurance she’d been missing. “Sizzi, I want to spend every day of the rest of our lives together showing you just how much.”

“Oh!”

“Sizzi?” He held her so close that she could feel his heart racing faster than hers. “What would it take for you to believe that I love you?”

“Kiss me like you mean it.”

So, he did.
