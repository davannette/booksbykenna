## If ever she found out … If ever she knew … Could she love the man who is Erebus?

Erebus thought he could run from his past. Until he met a woman who only wanted the truth. 

How could Felicity understand when he lost his career, the only thing he had left was his body? Silencing her questions with kisses, Erebus is desperate to keep his former life a secret forever. But how can he keep lying to her trusting eyes.

Felicity wasn’t looking for love but it found her. Only the man who stole her heart came with past as hot as his body. Can she ever be enough for the man who is Erebus?


**Who is Erebus** is book 1 in the **Passion without Rules** series taking one man from the popular Choose Your Own Romance series and giving him his own happily ever after.

Definitely a (reformed?) bad boy and with more steam than a sauna, if you met him in The Intern, you’ll want to know Who is Erebus!

**From the author**
Erebus was never intended to be a main character when he appeared in The Intern. It just happened that when Derek wanted to spice things up with Jade that the idea of a gorgeous man dressed in leather who was there to look, touch but do no more worked for the story line. <br>Even after finishing The Intern, I started dreaming about Erebus and soon realized if I wanted a good night's sleep, Erebus needed his happily ever after. I loved creating a romance where he is trying to escape from his past and struggles with how much to tell the woman who he believes is too good for him. As for Felicity, I loved her sweetness and how she reacted to learning about his past.<br>The side relationship between Erebus and Kitty is one of my favorites. They started off "working" together but quickly became like fiercely protective brother and sister. She deserved her happily ever after and now takes the lead in my introductory choose your own romance, The Bad Kitty. 

Cheating warning - Who is Erebus starts with Erebus leaving after a night "working" and realizing that with his debts paid, it is time to close down this chapter of his life. 

Even though my books are grouped into series, there is no "right" entry and each book can be read stand-alone.
