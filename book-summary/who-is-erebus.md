## If ever she found out … If ever she knew … Could she love the man who is Erebus?

**Erebus had it all.**

Promising career, expensive house, fancy car and friends happy for him to pick up the tab. Until one deal went sour and he lost it all. Unable to make money using his brain, he used the only thing he hadn’t lost.<br>
His body. So hot he needs a sauna to cool down.</p>

**Felicity wasn’t looking for love.**

A small town girl with passion for teaching students who had fallen through the gaps. She never thought her life would be changed in one afternoon.

With one meeting.

One man.

She gave him her heart and only asked for honesty in return. But now she knows the man Who is Erebus, can she ever accept the man behind the name and with a past?

**Who is Erebus** is book 1 in the Passion without Rules series taking one man from the popular Choose Your Own Romance series and giving him his own happily ever after.

Definitely a (reformed?) bad boy and with more steam than a sauna, if you met him in The Intern, you’ll want to know Who is Erebus!
