#### From the author

> The Perfect Wife is the latest in my choose your own romance series that features a complicated marriage. That Brynne loves Owen isn't in question - it is whether she wants to live her life as a corporate widow. Especially when another option has marched back into her life. Weaved throughout this romance is the desperate longing Brynne has for a child and the secret she's kept from her husband.
> 
> I love writing confrontation scenes, and this one will always be a fav as will the husband's revenge - or did he go too far? Let me know what you think.
> 
> Cheating warning - As Brynne explores who she is and what she wants out of life, there are times when she turns to a lover's arms. That's the whole point of choose your own romance - taking a woman at a cross road in her life and deciding which man will be her happily ever after.
> 
> What I love about Brynne is how much she tries to put everyone else's needs ahead of her own desires. Each of the endings are perfect for her in different ways and I can't wait to hear which one you choose.

> Even though my books are grouped into series, there is no "right" entry and each book can be read stand-alone.
