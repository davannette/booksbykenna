**From the author**
The Perfect Wife is the latest in my choose your own romance series that features a complicated marriage. That Brynne loves Owen isn't in question - it is whether she wants to live her life as a corporate widow. Especially when another option has marched back into her life. Weaved throughout this romance is the desperate longing Brynne has for a child and the secret she's kept from her husband.<br>I love writing confrontation scenes, and this one will always be a fav as will the husband's revenge.<br>Cheating warning - As Brynne explores who she is and what she wants out of life, there are times when she turns to a lover's arms. That's the whole point of choose your own romance - taking a woman at a cross road in her life and deciding which man will be her happily ever after.<br>Even though my books are grouped into series, there is no "right" entry and each book can be read stand-alone.
