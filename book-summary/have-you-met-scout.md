Sometimes there are minor characters in my books that make us want more. Early this year, I asked my readers to tell me what they wanted for Alex MacFarlane from [The Uni Student](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076NRVM5M/ "The Uni Student"). The response to [Have You Met ... Alex]({{ site.baseurl }}/book-summary/have-you-met-alex.html "Have You Met ... Alex") blew me away.

So in February, I asked my readers who they wanted for military hero Scout from [Protect Her](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07J429XPV/ "Protect Her"). Military nurse or female soldier. Here is the short but not sweet romance they asked for!

## Have you met ... Scout?

“Lieutenant!” Rick Vanguard assumed the voice meant another Lieutenant, after all they were almost a dime a dozen on base.

“Lieutenant Vanguard,” less chance for him to avoid the familiar voice of his Captain.

“Scout!” 

Oh, no. When Captain Whitehead resorted to his nickname, Lieutenant Rick Vanguard, otherwise known as Scout, knew he was in trouble.

“Captain, sorry sir.” Scout over emphasized his salute, hoping that a show of respect would be enough to appease his old friend.

“At ease, got time to walk?” Doug’s face showed the strain of the past month. All of them still had the tan from desert warfare, but their stress lines were more pronounced and none of them had come back from the last tour unchanged.

“Captain?” Scout owed Doug his life, actually all the guys who made it back to the Townsville army barracks in one piece owed their lives to this man. 

“How are the guys?” Doug lowered his voice, as if to extract a secret. Scout knew exactly what he wanted to know and wasn’t going to fall into that trap. 

“Fine, sir.”

“Scout, it’s me. Pretend for a minute that I’m not your Captain but just another bloke who’s asking.”

“They’re fine, sir. Glad to be back and eager to get our full complement back from sickbay.”

Scout pulled himself to his six foot four inches height and kept his brown eyes steady under the interrogative stare. He’d known Doug long enough to recognize the power of silence, waiting for Scout to say too much and open the door to psych evaluations and counsellors who thought they wanted to listen to the horrors of war. Uneffinglikely. 

“Scout?”

At least he’d outlasted the Captain. That had to be worth a free round of beers if he had the guts to tell the boys.

“Nothing that we can’t handle, sir. It was a rough tour but the boys have dug deep and are ready to go again.” He resisted ending with another, “Sir.” The explanation had to be believable but not over the top.

“Tomorrow’s gonna be tough on them, especially the youngsters that haven’t been to a funeral of one of their own before,” Doug threw out. Ahh, Scout thought, that’s why the Captain tracked him down. Already, Scout had inflicted more than his fair share of casualties, witnessed mates lose their lives in battle and others who had to get to used to a new sort of normal with broken bodies.

“Relax, Dougie, the kids will be fine. There’s enough of us old-timers to babysit them and we’ll all go out afterwards and sink a few beers.”

“Well listen to you, an old man at all of twenty-eight?” Doug at least had the grace to laugh.

“At least I look my age, and the ladies don’t seem to mind.”

“Anyone in particular?” Doug teased.

“Me and Jodes are still hanging out sometimes,” Scout shrugged, noncommittedly. “Not all of us can marry our childhood sweetheart, and not every girl is willing to wait for her soldier to come home.”

“Aint that the truth. Well, if you need a friend then reach out.”

Finally, Doug left him to his own devices. Luckily, the Captain hadn’t asked about his arm. Trapped in the truck when it rolled over, it had somehow gotten caught between flying equipment and the door. Nothing to complain about given all the other crap that had gone down, still he hadn’t been able to shoot straight since coming back and had been avoiding going up to the base hospital knowing that one nurse in particular would be wanting to give him the once over. Not yet, as much as he wanted to see Jodi, he had to survive the funeral first. 


“Are you going to the service tomorrow?” Jodi looked up from the stack of patient charts to see Charli’s still red eyes. 

“No, I’m on duty, but I’ll catch up with everyone later.”

“I can’t believe …” Jodi didn’t blame Charli for breaking down. They’d all worked so bloody hard to get the last batch of wounded soldiers back on their feet, but sometimes their minds couldn’t be helped and Charli had been one of the last to see Private Barron at their physio session. 

“There was nothing you could have done, look you don’t need to go. I could use the company here. There’s just gonna be me and a dozen gorgeous men,” Jodi tried to force a laugh.

“Yeah, and what are you gonna do with them? I mean, Scout’s back isn’t he?” 

“I got a thumbs up emoji when he got back but he’s been busy and you know how crazy it’s been here. If things don’t slow down, I’ll be able to put down a house deposit based on overtime alone.”

“Well, I’d better pull myself together and smile for my clients,” Charli grabbed her first patient file. “Great, first up is a back injury.”

“Drinks tonight?” Jodi called after her friend.

“How about you track down lover-boy and release some of that tension I’m sure you both have.”

Jodi let Charli’s comment slide and busied herself with rounds. Her main role these last few days had been to try and lift the guys’ spirits. Some of them she knew through Scout, Mack and the boys. Others were younger and terrified that the black dog could take any of them. For some reason, they seemed to talk to her more than any of the formal counsellors and Dr Hunter had encouraged her to spend as much time as necessary with fake “busy work” so she could listen.

“Those boys spend most of their lives being strong physically and mentally and while they’ll turn up for mandatory psych sessions, we can’t force them to open up. You’ve got their trust.”

“You mean, I’m just a nurse so I can’t hurt their career with written reports.”

“Jodi,” Dr Hunter had stopped her. “You are more than ‘just a nurse’ and they know it. You are an exceptional nurse and I don’t know of anyone who can build a rapport with the soldiers so quickly. They open up to you and trust when you refer them to OT or physio. They know that you care about them more than just another broken soldier.”

“That’s easy,” Jodi choked knowing that there were no secrets on base. “Any one of them could be Scout.”

“He’s a lucky man.”


“Busy?” 

Finally, a text message from Scout. Arriving home after a twenty-hour shift, Jodi was too tired to read anything into the single word. She hadn’t taken a break or even had time to drink any of the cups of tea she tried to make and if the kitchen hadn’t made her a sandwich to eat on the run, food would have been a distant memory too.

“Tired,” the only reply she had the energy to type.

“Back rub?” Despite herself, Jodi smiled. If Scout had suggested coffee, then it would have meant anything but a drink. But a back rub could actually mean a back rub!

“Sure.” If he thought it would lead to anything else, he’d be sadly mistaken. 

Jodi looked towards her bed and the bathroom. Her feet were killing her and a long soak in the tub would do her the world of good. Then again, comfy bed, soft pillow and she’d be asleep within seconds. Automatically, she turned the kettle on, thinking that having made dozens of cups of tea and coffee for patients as a way of inviting them to talk, the very least she owed herself was to sit down in peace and enjoy a chai latte. 

Peeling off her uniform, Jodi checked out her body in the small bathroom mirror. Not that she needed to lose any weight, but the last couple of weeks had taken their toll on her small frame. Hours on her feet and without time to eat, her waist had shrunk and her high cheekbones even more pronounced. Nothing that a couple of days off wouldn’t fix, perhaps she could drop into her grandmother’s place in Brisbane and allow the home cooking to tempt her appetite. Then again, hours travelling or sleep – right now the idea of sleep was the winner.

At least her pale brown eyes could still fake perkiness. They were always the first thing a new patient noticed, well that and her smile. Jodi had grown up learning that as long as she looked happy, people didn’t bother asking questions. It helped during her parent’s separation and divorce, and then again when her father had died from cancer when she was still in high school. After the divorce lawyers had shredded whatever friendship could have remained between her warring parents, Jodi grieved alone and behind a smiling mask for the man her mother could only hate.

To hell with them all, Jodi cleaned her face from all make up and shook out her long, mid-brown hair. If Scout turned up, he could take her au naturel.

Still, no matter how she smoothed her hair down her chest, it couldn’t hide her most hated part of her body, small boobs; not that any guy had ever complained but they always seemed inadequate in comparison to other women. Not that she’d ever have the money to do anything about them because any spare money went straight to her house deposit savings account. There was no way on hell she’d ever make the same mistake as her mother and rely on a man for a house over her head. 

Of course, the moment she sat down in the warm bath, cup of hot tea at the side and two slices of toast with butter still melting, she heard her front door open. Scout knew where she kept the spare and had crashed here more than once even when she was working, as she had told him it was better he stay in town at her place than ride that monstrosity of a bike home while drunk.

“Babe? Jodes?” As he called, she could already imagine his hands on her body. No. She needed sleep!

“In here,” knowing the echo from the bathroom would show him the way.

“Damn, Jodes.”

The moment Scout removed his sunglasses, she saw her soldier turn into a man. The tough jawline softened and the dark brown eyes welled with hated tears, proof of how emotionally raw the day must have been for him and probably all of the guys on base. Still wearing his dress uniform, Jodi didn’t have to ask, he’d gone straight from the funeral to drink or look after his men and now come home to her.

Not that this was his home, but as much as either of them were willing to be a couple, this is what they had.

She wanted to say how sorry she was for his loss but couldn’t.

He’d been home over a week and this was the first time he’d reached out.

Booty call? She didn’t want to ask herself the question when the answer was obvious. 

“You promised me a back rub,” knowing he couldn’t resist her coquettish smile.

Wordlessly, Scout removed his glossy shoes, tie and shirt. She caught her breath, oh, he was gorgeous. Tanned from hours of playing volleyball or cricket in the hot sun and toned from hours in the gym. Jodi’s tired body could still react to the man climbing behind her in the small bath tub.

She flinched as he poured cold bath gel across her back before his hand warmed to their job. Deep, penetrating strokes up her spine and circles releasing each of her knots. 

Jodi felt him grow against her cheeks as his hands made tentative movements up her waist and around to cup her breasts.

“Still tired?” he asked, pulling her hair out of the way to kiss her neck. Their first kiss in months.

“Mmm,” she leaned back, letting him take her full weight as his hands explored wherever they wanted to go. Deftly one edged its way between her legs and her tiredness eased as her breathing increased. This could have been a dream, she didn’t have to do a thing other than allow him to be with her. The moment she arched her back in pleasure as his fingers found their opportunity, Scout raised her until the only place she could go was to be joined with him.

Her back was completely ignored as Scout continued to massage her breasts and bud in unison. Bringing her further to a peak until her cries echoed off the bathroom walls and he shuddered beneath.

“Like I said, damn Jodes.” Scout pulled her face around towards him, so their lips could finally meet.

“I think you missed a knot,” she smiled, pointing to between her shoulder blades.

“I’ve got all night if you do.”

“Try three days off,” all thoughts of sleeping or going away were cancelled. Despite the undefined nature of whatever they had, Jodi’s body had missed Scout almost as much as she did.



Scout softly padded across Jodi’s bedroom floor to the kitchen. Not that he needed to worry, after the bath, he’d given her the promised back rub until she fell asleep. 

They hadn’t spoken about the months he’d been away and didn’t call. Or about the last week when he’d been trying just to survive the clustereff of settling back into base only to lose one of their own. Jodi didn’t even ask him about the funeral or why he hadn’t asked her to meet up with him after. 

If she was any other woman, Scout would think that she didn’t care or didn’t understand. But he knew differently. For some damned reason, when Jodi needed a rebound fling to get over a broken heart, she’d chosen him and he’d been happy enough to have some fun with a woman who’s smile could erase sore muscles and who’s eyes made him think he was the only man in the world.

As for him, Scout never cared about having a relationship before Jodes; after all women came into and left his life as readily as breathing. Sometimes he remembered their name, mostly not. At first, Jodi had been convenient, a regular woman on base who fit neatly in his arms, bed and life to the exclusion of all others. To look at her, anyone would think petite equalled fragile, but Scout had seen the effortless way she turned her patients, knew the hours of hard and physical work and had heard from his mates how her strength had helped them get through some dark nights.

Earlier today, he’d stood at the funeral but instead of listening to the service or watching the coffin, he’d been struck by the mourners. Even though Private Barron was only mid twenties, he’d lived a full life. Not only were the Army represented, but also the Royal Surf Lifesaving club he had volunteered at during his teens. The woman he met a week before enlisting had become his wife within six months and had given him two adorable children. Barron lived life, yes, he had died far too young, but at least he had left a legacy.

If Scout died tomorrow, he thought, what the hell would he leave behind? A couple of medals for his parents to show off? A few mates who’d raise a toast on ANZAC Day each year? 

He’d never cared about his future before because he figured the Army would take care of that and there was nothing else he’d rather do. He still had the passion for serving his country but standing at the grave side and paying his respects to Cate Barron, he wanted more.

The only question, was Jodi the right woman for him, or had they run their course?



The sun was streaming through the small window when Jodi woke up, alone and naked. The left side of her bed smoothed down as if she’d slept alone and she didn’t need to call out to know that Scout had gone.

She bit down until her lip threatened to bleed, why on earth did she think last night would have been different? With more than a touch of bitterness, she tried to remind herself that all soldiers were the same and she’d been a fool to think that Scout could ever be any different.

The empty fridge taunted her, and the last thing she felt like was making yet another cup of tea. Quickly dressing in plaid cotton shorts and grabbing a white shirt from the laundry hamper, she grabbed her bag and car keys. Only when she’d driven half way down the street did she realize her phone was still on the charger back home. To go and get it? Why bother, she immediately answered herself. She was on leave and after yesterday’s marathon effort, the hospital would know better than to call her back in; most of her friends would be at work and she could catch up with them for drinks later. As for Scout, well, his disappearing act was all the answer she needed.

Booty call.

At least he gave great back rub.

Screw him.

She couldn’t help but smile, yes indeed. By no stretch of her imagination could she have called it “making love.” It had been physical release and emotional relief, for both of them. The phone could charge while she headed into town and found something to eat because for the first time in a week, her need for food was greater than her need for sleep.

After demolishing an egg and bacon roll and first coffee, Jodi drove out to the Jezzine Barracks precinct that was deserted other than mums and strollers out for their mid-week catch-ups. Avoiding the joyful sounds of the children she was unlikely to ever be lucky enough to have, she wandered along the coastal boardwalk to Kissing Point. Jodi didn’t care that her hair was being blown wild in the ocean breeze, after all she spent most of her time with it pulled back into a tight bun. No, feeling the sun on her legs and wind in her hair was the tonic she needed. Almost as much as kicking off her shoes and paddling in the rock pool.

Ahh, if her back needed the massage, then her feet needed the sand to crunch as she walked and then the cool water lapping around her ankles. 

Out of nowhere, she wanted to cry. One minute, she was enjoying nature and feeling at peace and the next she wanted to wallow in self pity and the only reason was because Scout had left her bed without saying, “good bye.”

They didn’t have that kind of relationship, no commitments and nothing serious. He owed her nothing and she owed him even less, yet she sat at the edge of the rock pool and pretended to herself that her tears were relief that at least he’d come home safe.


“Hey! You made it!” Charli was the first to pull Jodi to a table at their favorite pub. “How was your day off?” 

“Relaxing,” Jodi poured herself a glass from the jug sitting in the middle of the table. She didn’t ask what it was and didn’t care. Cold and alcoholic were her only requirements.

“Seems like you spent more time in the sun than bed, that sunburn is going to be a killer tomorrow.” 

Jodi squealed as her friend rubbed ice against her burning skin. “Would you not do that! I went out to get some breakfast and ended up out at Jezzine for a couple of hours. I didn’t notice how hot it was until I got back.”

“Alone?” Charli lowered her voice. 

“He came, he saw, he conquered and then left before I woke up,” Jodi knew Charli wouldn’t judge. “No big deal.”

“If you say so.”

“We’re not a thing. If we were, it would bug me, but we’re not so he can do what he likes.”

“And so can you,” Charli gave her a quick hug before running off to greet more friends.

Tonight, she didn’t feel like drinking or partying, after the day of self-reflection she was prepared to sit back and be absorbed by everyone else’s laughter. Charli was right, she could do whatever she wanted and it was about time Mack, Scout and any other bloody soldier was put in her rear view mirror and she start looking for a man who could actually want a relationship. The more she sipped on her drink, the more Jodi tried to convince herself that Scout had only ever been a rebound, someone she could hang out with while never opening up her heart to the hurt of unrequited love.

Once should have been enough, especially when Mack moved on and she saw how happy he was with the “right” woman.

Now it had to be her turn to find true love, or whatever you called it, and Scout had served his purpose as someone to fill in time with, Jodi tried to convince herself.

It didn’t matter that whenever they were together, time and distance didn’t count. Or that his was the first name she looked for on any patient lists, or even worse, the casualty lists. Or that her reputation of being a good listener was because sometimes she learned more about the man in her bed from his mates than from the soldier himself. His fearless disregard for his own safety when looking out for the man beside him. Loyalty to all and a calmness that commanded respect and the highest regard.

The clanging of an old cow bell silenced the bar. No words were necessary as the music fell silent and everyone stood, hand across their heart. A pub tradition for a full minute’s silence at six pm every night that was respected even by small children waiting for their dinner and not needing a reminder not to talk during this incredibly special minute.

A moment to cherish those who were away and remember those who wouldn’t come back.

It almost seemed poetic when the bell rung again that Jodi looked up to see Scout make his way to the table and to her.

“How’s the sleeping princess?” he greeted her with a light peck. Nothing that would indicate to anyone they were more than friends with a sometimes special connection.

“My itches were scratched, but there’s still a knot in my back,” Jodi could play this game.

“You couldn’t handle me two nights in a row,” he teased, leaning over to grab a handful of peanuts. No one else would have heard.

Before she could stop herself, Jodi reacted with the hurt from waking up alone, “Who said you’d get the chance to find out?”

To hell with him.

Screw him, actually scratch that. Ignore then forget him.

As Jodi joined the locals at the pool tables, she tried to convince herself that the thing with Scout had run its course and she was ready for something real.



“Okay boys,” Reith led the call that always followed the bell, would silence the bar and announce to all the single women that the army boys were in town.

“Rule one,” Reith shouted.

“Reapers come,” baritone voices called from all corners.

“Rule two,” yep, they had the full attention of the bar.

“Reapers see,” the huge cry and Scout watched the drunk Reith pause before the final rule.

“Rule three!”

“Reapers conquer.”

“And don’t forget,” Reith finished before they all joined in, “We never leave a Reaper behind.”

While Scout had joined in the Army cry, he could only watch as Jodi left him stranded at the table, having to make polite conversation with their friends. Not his or her friends, but their friends. Too many of his mates had hooked up with staff at the hospital and made something permanent out of it.

Looking around, yes there were a heap of single guys from the barracks, but he was one of the few single guys left from his intake with most now married with children and the remainder were well on their way to wedded bliss.

“Lost your woman?” his wingman, Reith slurred. One thing he could always count on was that Reith would start drinking the moment he was on leave and would time sobriety to hit just as the leave ended. “Mate, you need to control her better.”

“Eff off,” Scout didn’t pay much mind to the drunken ramblings.

“She should be by your side, not out there with some local randoms.”

“We’re fine, don’t you have a beer that needs refilling?”

“Where is your friend?” he asked Charli, trying not to show his concern.

“I don’t know, where did you leave her last?” The blue eyes stared him down. “Don’t tell me you left her sleeping and didn’t have the guts to stay the night or call her today?”

“It’s not like that and you know it.”

“Whatever, you tell yourself.” Usually accepting of him and Jodes, tonight Charli was uncharacteristically cutting. “How about you go off and find some little tramp to stick it in tonight and let Jodi find someone who will be there in the morning.”

He wanted to tell Charli where to stick her advice, but the call of another round of drinks and a pretty blonde with bedroom eyes beckoned. Perhaps Charli was right, on both accounts.



Jodi didn’t expect to wake up naked for a second morning in a row. Her body still glowing from a night of pure sex, making love and everything in between.

Rolling over, the sheets were crumpled but this time, a gorgeous naked man sat in front of the bedroom window, watching the sun rise.

He startled as her hand draped over his shoulders, “Morning.” Without asking, she sat in his lap, feeling him rise as their kisses picked up from where they left off only hours ago.

“I think you answered the question,” Scout said between breaths. 

“I’m enjoying the answer, but what was the question again?” Oh, she couldn’t be ready for him again! Surely!

“I didn’t think you could handle me two nights in a row.”

“So this was an experiment?” Jodi tried not to freeze waiting for his answer. 

“Consider it an act of extreme kindness,” he laughed, playing with her nipple. “I didn’t want you to settle for some local guy when you could have your way with all this.”

“But the local guys have something you don’t,” Jodi threw back, hoping Scout would at least pretend to be jealous. “The ability to make me breakfast! In all the months we haven’t been together, you’ve never even made me a cup of tea.”

“Oh, you wicked wench. Here I was thinking the way to your heart was a warm cock and a good back rub?” 

Jodi couldn’t help but laugh as Scout effortlessly picked her up and plonked her down on the kitchen bench. 

“So, this is a kitchen? I’ve heard that they exist.” With more skill than she expected, Scout got water on to boil, broke four eggs into plastic bags and while the eggs were poaching, cooked up some toast and turkey bacon. “I hope you like runny yolks,” he broke open the plastic bags to slide the eggs onto the plate.

“Is there any other way?” Jodi was still amazed he knew how to cook.

“Well, woman, how about you find something to wear so I don’t have to choose between you and food!”

It could have been the most perfect of all days, until he left to get the makings for a home cooked dinner, and two hours later Jodi realized he wasn’t coming back.



Scout had every intention of grabbing some steaks and heading back to Jodi’s before she had time to miss him.

Except he saw Cate Barron try and herd her two little ones into the supermarket. The slumped shoulders and empty eyes captured his heart. Instead of going home to Jodi and another night of loving, he organized an impromptu picnic for Cate, the kids and some of the other guys who were on leave. The kids responded to the attention and Cate seemed grateful to hear all the wacky stories about her late husband from the people who knew him almost as well as she had.

It never occurred to him to invite Jodi until it was too late and he’d have to explain how doing the right thing for Cate meant he put his own desires last.

“I don’t regret it,” Cate said as he helped her pack the sleeping kids into their car seats.

“What’s that?”

“Loving him. We might not have had long together, but I’d rather those six years with him than without.”

“He loved you and the kids,” which made his last decision so bloody impossible to understand.

“The Army was his life, but not his whole life.” Cate mused before turning her gaze to him. “What about you, other than the Army, what else do you have?” Cate made no move to get in and leave. Scout didn’t blame her, most of the time he felt the same.

“There’s a girl,” he admitted. Once Cate and the kids moved back to her parents, he’d never have to see her again and this conversation could be forgotten. “We’ve been seeing each other on and off for a while.”

“I didn’t see you with anyone, does she live near here?”

“Yeh, she’s a nurse on base.”

“Working?”

“No, I kinda left her to get groceries and ended up here,” it sounded worse when he said the words. “Look, we have an understanding.”

“What exactly do you both understand?”

“I guess that neither of us want anything serious.”

“Are you seeing anyone else?” 

Scout thought back to the blonde who he left at the bar after half a drink. Pretty, available but not his type. “Nah.”

“Is she?” 

Again, Scout remembered his blood boiling watching other guys play pool with Jodes. Yes, she’d been relaxed and having fun, but all the flirting was one sided and she didn’t give him any reason to doubt things were different when he was away. “Like I said, we haven’t had the conversation, but I don’t think so.”

He’d want to kill any bastard who tried. 

Instead of judgement, Cate smiled, “You’re a good man and I appreciate what you did for me and the kids tonight. I want them to remember their dad, and you’ll never know how much it meant to hear about his other life. But now, you need to get her the biggest bunch of flowers, chocolates and smother her in apologies and tomorrow buy her something gold.”

“Why would I do that?” Oh damn, he’d been an idiot not to call Jodes earlier and watch her with the kids. They’d never talked about the future and he didn’t even know if she wanted children or whether she was happy being married to a career?

“Because if she opens her door to you tonight, then whether she admits it or not, she’s already in the relationship and you don’t want to spend the rest of your life wishing you’d done things differently.”



Jodi only intended to wait half an hour for Scout. After all, the shops were only ten minutes away and he was only getting meat, bread and some vegetables. Then she thought that perhaps he’d got caught in traffic – unlikely but still giving him the benefit of the doubt – or that there might have been queues at the supermarket.

Surely it didn’t take more than an hour? Or two?

Slowly, Jodi got changed into her tightest black jeans that showed off her curves and found a bright yellow halter neck top that with the right bra would attract all the wrong attention.

Dark charcoal eye make-up and heavy mascara completed the, “I don’t care” look she wanted.

Only she did.

This whole not having a relationship wasn’t working, at least not for her.

One of the guys last night had invited her to join their mixed touch football team. Have fun, make new friends away from the Army base that consumed her waking thoughts and energy. Her new friends made sense and perhaps it was time to meet someone who was ready to blindly fall head over heels in love with her. As Jodi locked her front door and got in the waiting taxi, she thought she’d settle for any guy who didn’t make her feel aweful after allowing her to feel like she meant everything.

The crash was far worse than the heady heights of passion.

There were two bars in town she and her friends liked, one was frequented by the Army guys and the other was quieter and more relaxed. A place to chill and hang out rather than flirt and pick up. A quick text to a couple of her friends and she headed to the darkened bar room where she could blame any tears on a pathetic attempt at playing darts instead of admitting that yet again, she’d lost her heart to the wrong man.

By the time Belle, Charli, Kalia and Dylan arrived, Jodi had already joined a table of the touch footballers from last night, including some of the girls who had already asked if she could fill in for them during school holidays.

Three drinks in and Jodi was willing to agree to just about anything that would give her life purpose, meaning and would take away the pain of yet another broken effing heart.

“Where’s Scout?” Belle pulled her aside to get another round of drinks. “I thought the two of you looked tight last night.”

“So did I,” Jodi shrugged. “Right up until he left to get something for dinner and didn’t come back?”

“Oh, bae,” hugs before drinks. Jodi tried not to let Belle’s concern break down her shaky defences. “I thought he’d come around.”

“It doesn’t matter. We were never serious.” Jodi forced a smile not even her mother would know was fake. “I needed a rebound and he needed a sure thing for when he had time.”

"Oh, you’ve got it that bad for him?” Bella knew all about falling for the wrong guy. “Should we stop you from doing anything stupid with any of the guys at your table?”

“I think I’m all stupided out. No rebound this time, I just time to figure out what the hell I want or even where I want to live. There’s some jobs back in Brisbane that I was thinking about applying for.”

“Running away?”

“Have you got a better idea?”

Jodi followed her friend back to the table and tried to enjoy the light banter and get to know her new potential team mates.



It didn’t really come as a surprise when Scout got back to Jodi’s to an empty unit. Even the spare key wasn’t in the usual place and he had no way of getting inside to wait for her. 

How bloody difficult would it have been to talk to her this morning instead of hiding his feelings with sex? Yeah, it was great and sometimes the best way of communicating but still. He couldn’t tell her that he rarely allowed himself to fall into a deep sleep because the risk of waking up with night terrors was too great. The smell of base was strangely comforting, but any time he tried to sleep somewhere else, whether hotels or even next to Jodi, he’d wake up covered in sweat and in full body shakes. Luckily, Jodi hadn’t woken the other night before he left her sleeping, but last night he decided against even trying. Resting in the chair at the window was as good as it got but even then, he couldn’t silence the screams in his head or stop the visions from replacing dreams.

He should have at least tried to explain. As a sort-of girlfriend, she wouldn’t have been obliged to dob him into the shrinks or let anyone else know and she might even have access to something that could help.

Instead, he took the first bloody opportunity to find a reason to avoid talking and now he didn’t have a bloody clue where she could be.

Scout pulled into the bar from the night before, but other than some familiar faces from the base, there were no locals and no Jodi. He’d already tried texting and calling but she’d either done the smart thing and blocked him or had decided to become a ghost.

“Is she with you?” he texted Charli and tried not to watch his phone not respond.

Five, ten, fifteen minutes later, he texted again. 

Another five minutes and he called. 

“What do you want?” Scout could always trust Charli to be straight up – either on her physio table or on behalf of her friends.

“Jodes, is she with you and is she alright.”

“You are a real bastard, do you know that?”

“Probably, but I want to see her.”

“Too bad.” 

The phone went dead and yet another woman had sent him straight to message bank.

“Lost your woman again?” Trust Reith to corner him in the only quiet part of the bar. The guys had become rowdy, the night promised to get dirty but Scout would prefer another quiet night in a bath tub with a brunette called Jodi. 

Trying to think, there had been the sound of laughter and glasses in the background when he was talking to Charli. They were out, but not here. Not the weekend so they wouldn’t have headed out of town.

“Mate,” he asked the barman and offered him some folded notes. “I was a prick and my girl has gone out with friends to get over me.”

The fit guy looked him up and down. “You Army guys never stay alone for long. If she’s smartened up about you, then do what you guys do naturally, skull a few drinks and find another one.”

“That’s just it, I don’t want to. She and me have had the whole, ‘nothing serious’ kind of non-relationship but I think I’m ready to make it serious.”

“Think?” the guy challenged him.

Scout didn’t want to put it all out there, but with chatter about having to go back for another tour soon, if he didn’t man up and start talking to Jodi now, by the time he came back she would have probably moved on for good this time.

“Know. I know that I’ve been a prick and I’m just as certain she can do better, but if I don’t find her and tell her how I feel then we’ll never know.”

“She that cute brunette that was playing pool last night?”

“Pale brown eyes that light up the room,” Scout replied without thinking.

“Man, you do have it hard. She seemed to be getting on well with the Sharkies.”

“Sharkies?”

“Local mixed touch football team. I don’t sponsor them, but another bar in town does. Army guys drink here, locals like to stick together.”

“I heard other voices, glasses. She’s out with friends and I hoped she’d be here.”

The barman’s stare was uncomfortably direct. Scout felt less fear leaving the safe zone overseas. This guy held his future and wasn’t giving up any information without a bloody good reason.

“Look, pour me a drink and I’ll be straight with you.”

“Can’t tell the truth without some liquid courage? Wow, you really are a catch,” the sarcasm thick.

“I’ve seen stuff that I can’t tell her about, and there’s no way she’d ever look at me the same if I told her what I’ve done for this country. I check out in the middle of the night so she doesn’t wake up and find me either shaking or screaming.”

“Here,” a free shot of bourbon appeared in front of Scout. “You guys come in, drink up but it takes guts to put it on the table like you just did.”

“I never wanted to get serious about anyone, didn’t want anyone to end up getting the ‘I’m sorry for your loss’ visit after my dumb luck runs out.”

“This girl is different?”

“Jodi, man she is everything. We’ve been ‘not serious’ for almost a year. I was her rebound and she was my reason for coming back home alive.”

“And you’ve never told her.”

“I will today, if I can get a word in before she decides to take up one of your Sharkies.”

“Replacing one rebound with another.”

“You saw us together last night, do you think I’m still a rebound?”

A business card was slid across the bar. “If her friends are out with locals, you’ll find them at this address. Good luck and thank you for your service.”



“Can I speak with you for a minute,” Jodi turned in shock. Charli had said that Scout had been looking for her, but none of her friends would have told him where to find them. She looked around, wishing someone could help, but not knowing what help she wanted. Other than for Scout to man up and treat her with respect, or for someone to cut him out of her heart like a cancer and escort him from her life.

“Jodes, please,” he pleaded, standing next to her but still giving her a little space. Not threatening or intimidating, just a man asking to talk.

He had shed the black leather jacket and without looking at his face all she could see were his biceps bulging against the plain white T-shirt. How long would it take to not remember every inch of his body or for his scent to disappear from her memory?  

She looked again at her new friends, knowing she’d never been able to resist Scout on her own. How bloody pathetic and stupid, she thought, to keep falling in love with army guys who’d never love her in return.

“Are you going to introduce us to your friend, or dump us to go off with him,” Simon asked with a confident swagger knowing he’d have half a dozen friends at the table to back him if needed.

Scout wouldn’t hurt them, she knew. Away from his job, he had a gentle soul and when he wasn’t breaking her heart, he filled it with so much joy and desire. Damn him for coming here.

“Give me a sec,” Jodi shrugged as much for herself, accepting Scout’s hand to help her up from the table.

“Are you sure?” Belle asked offering a cautionary arm.

“No. But if he cares enough to track me down here maybe I want to hear what he's got to say.”

Her hand remained limp in his as she followed him to the corner of the bar, still in sight of her friends but away from prying ears.

“Who the hell are you with?” Scout started, not hiding his slow burn anger. 

Jodi had hoped he had tracked her down to apologize for ditching her, even admit she wasn’t the only one wanting this thing between them to be serious. But, if she thought Scout was going to whisper sweet nothings, his outburst set her straight.

“Some friends,” she hedged, not wanting to tell him that she might have found a new sport and team to play with. Information that her boyfriend would deserve to know, but not a guy who could leave her bed in the middle of the night, or the middle of an afternoon and expect her not to care.

“You ditched me for that guy?” Jodi liked the twinge of jealousy and wanted to play it up. 

“Which one in particular,” she laughed. “Or do you think I'm setting them up for one at a time enjoyment?” Surely he could see she was joking?

“You can be such a bitch,” her friends looked over at the raised voice. As his rage grew, so did her need to let him have the full force of her hurt.

“Really,” she almost yelled. “You left to get food for dinner and then what - did you get lost? Or find a better offer? I mean you've given the whole, ‘no commitment let's just have some fun, Jodes’ speech so often I could sing it in my sleep.”

“Well you didn't look like you were wanting anything serious back there – nothing to cramp your style when I’m away!”

“Are you okay?” The barman interrupted their yelling match.

“I'm fine,” Jodi wanted to walk away and hide amongst her girlfriends but held onto hope when Scout blocked her path.

“Jodi please,” Scout held her to his chest, his heart beating firm against her own. “What if we were serious?

After all this time, she knew he only asked out of jealousy. He didn’t really want her, just didn’t want her to be happy with anyone else.

“That's hard to do when you leave in the middle of the night,” she sighed. “You can't even find your way back from the shops.”

“Jodes, let me explain …” she pushed his face away before one kiss ruined her resolve.

“Okay, what about how long had you been on base before you thought to send me a text, even then it was for a thirty seconds booty call.” Even though she had kept her voice low, it felt a if the entire bar could hear her shame.

“You didn't answer the question, what if we were serious?” Again, he tried to kiss her.

“I don't think you understand the question. Being serious, means you have to give a damn about the other person – tell me Ric - in what lifetime have you even pretended to give a damn about me.”

She’d never used his real name before, but it was the name she wanted to cry out in love but had always held back. Pushing off his arm, Jodi stumbled towards her friends only for him to catch up and turn her back into his arms.

In full view and hearing of the group, he said so seriously that she wanted to believe, “What if I told you that I want us – Jodi I mean it - I want us.”

“I'd say you are either lying to yourself or lying to me.” He couldn’t possibly mean it, and if she believed him and he walked away again, it would be too much for her to bare. Far better he walk away now and let her try and learn to live without ever being in his arms again.

“Is this a lie?”

When Scout lips touched hers all her anger faded and as she allowed herself to be swept up in the moment; hoping that one day a man would kiss her like that again and feel as much for her as she did for Scout. But as much as she desperately wanted to believe him, the evidence was overwhelmingly against them. He’d never wanted to be serious until he saw her out with friends, willing him to love her wouldn’t make it happen.

“I'm sorry; I think you should go.”

Thankfully Simon and the guys let her squeeze around the other side of the round table to the waiting arms of her friends and then blocked Scout’s path.

“Jodi? Please Jodes,” he cried and while every part of her wanted to believe, she couldn't.

Less than a minute after he left, her phone beeped, and she couldn’t ignore looking at this message any more than she had to the dozen or so from before.

“I love you. I only wish I had told you before.”

Not knowing what else to say, she sent him the saddest emoji in reply.

“Is it too late?” His reply quickly appeared.

Jodi put her phone on silent and zipped it away into her bag.

“Well that was fun, not,” Simon tried to joke. “C,mon, let's get the party started and we’ll soon have you thinking about winning football games instead of army losers.”

Jodi silently listened as Charli and Belle decided to dissect what they had seen of her relationship with Scout. Through their eyes, he came across as a royal user while she seemed like a pathetic push over. Was that really how her friends saw them?

Then again, they only heard about the missing phone calls and disappearing acts. She never told anyone about picnics and making out down at Jezzine or the surprise “reverse care” packages that would appear from an anonymous sender when he was away on tour. Perfume, melted lipsticks, even random writing paper. All without a card but enough to know he was thinking of her.

Nothing serious, except in how he made her feel. Lying awake, talking half the night until his foot massages turned into a back rub that only ended in her sleeping.

“I think it's my shout,” she said to no one in particular, going up to the bar.

“Tough day, love?” At least the crusty old barman seemed sympathetic.

“You could say that.”

“Took some guts, that guy of yours.”

“He's not my guy.” How quickly she was used to hosing down any expectation, even her own.

“Really? Could have fooled me. An army guy who dares to come into enemy territory, go up and put it off there for a girl - I reckon he thinks he's your guy.”

“We had a thing, but he didn't want anything serious, so when you look at it that way, he’s never wanted to be my guy.” 

“What about you?” 

The barman left her to pour the jugs of beer and soda for the table. Jodi thought, if she couldn't be honest with herself at least she could be honest with a barman she never had to see again.

“It’s been serious for me for a while now, but I'm sick of loving someone who will never love me back.”

“Again, if you don't mind me saying, the guy who came in didn't look angry to see you with those other guys, he looked destroyed and I've seen a few broken hearts in my time.

“He sent me a text,” she admitted, not willing to share her secret with her friends.

“And – that smile on your face has to mean something.”

“He said he loves me, and he's never said that before.”

“And …” the last jug was filled and put on the tray to carry over.

“He hopes it's not too late.”

“Then, what the hell are you still doing here?” When he put it like that, Jodi didn’t have an answer, at least not one she could explain.

“I guess my friends think I deserve better.”

“Honey, we all deserve better, but the heart wants what the heart wants.”

Jodi looked over to her waiting friends, knowing they’d try to protect her from her own impulses. Quickly handing over her credit card for the drinks, “Do you mind waiting a couple of minutes and taking these over?”

“Sure, love, there's a taxi rank around the corner, good luck.”



Scout gunned the bike.
What the hell was with the sad emoji? The only two options were that either Jodi didn't give a hoot about him after all, or he’d come across as a sad and pathetic loser by tracking her down and declaring his love.

Did it really matter, he thought, accelerating to try and rid his brain of all the messed up self talk? She’d never know how much guts it had taken for him to say three simple words he’d never said to any woman before. Not only had she brushed him off with an emoji he had no idea whether that was her final word

So caught up in his head, Scout didn’t notice the oil slick over the loose gravel on the road until it was too late. Over-correcting, he couldn’t control the slide onto the wrong side of the road any more than the car load of teens could avoid hitting him.

The last thing Scout remembered was Jodi‘s face and hearing or at least imagining that he could hear her gut-wrenching scream.



The taxi driver had known a short cut back to base, joining the main drag just in time to see a car hit a motor-bike and send the cyclist metres into the air.

The red and gold reaper insignia was impossible not to notice and Jodi’s scream started as she jumped out of the taxi, pushing her way through to Scout’s body lying on the road.

“Don’t you damn well leave me!” she sobbed before looking up. “Who’s calling an ambulance?”

One of the teens remained trapped in the car that had landed on its side, while the other passengers were trying to get them out.

Jodi tried to remember what they do in movies, all she could think was to keep talking to Scout and somehow make him wake up. Not caring how it sounded to the gathering crowd, she kept up a monotone, repeating the same things over again and hoping that one day he’d laugh about her trying to bore him to death. Squeezing his gloved hand, Jodi tried not to think about the distant sirens, hoping that more than one ambulance was on its way so no-one would have to choose between a teen and her man.

“This is such a aweful way to get my attention,” she forced a smile when his eyes finally opened. “I mean, we’ve had the whole, ‘nothing serious’ talk but what’s with this new approach?”

Good, she thought, at least he tried to wink at her.

“I’m not going to fall for those gorgeous eyes! No, you can damn well get up on your feet and tell me face to face instead of hiding in a text. I mean, who the hell tells a woman he loves her by text?”

Afraid to touch his helmet, Jodi could only see Scout’s eyes. At least they were still open and completely focused on her.

“Soldier, I want a do-over. I want dinner and flowers and all the romance you could ever dream up and then I want you to say those words again.”

She could hear the paramedics arriving. Any moment now, she’d be pushed out of the way so they could save his life. 

“Do you hear me, Ric? I’ll wait by your bedside all bloody night and tomorrow and all the days after that until you have the courage to tell me to my face.”

“Ma’am, can you please step aside?”



He woke to the sounds of machines burring, beeping and a headache worse than any hangover he’d had before – and he’d had a few. Unable to turn his head, he tried clearing his dry throat, hoping some angel of mercy would have some ice chips handy.

“Hey, soldier,” he could only imagine Jodi until she moved into vision. Oh, she was gorgeous even if she was still in the yellow top and the cutest hip hugging jeans from last night – he assumed the accident had only happened last night. Surely he hadn’t been out for days.

“Thirsty,” he croaked. With so much to say, he needed ice or something to be able to give his words any justice.

Bless her, Jodi only left the room for seconds before returning with a cup of ice and a teaspoon to feed him the soothing chips.

“I’ve let the doctor know that you’re awake and someone will be in to check on you shortly. I’ve contacted the base hospital and you’ll be transferred there today or tomorrow.

“Need to talk,” he croaked again, trying to raise his hand to grab hers. “Please.”

“Yeah, we do,” she laughed. “Seriously, you’ve got my attention and I’m not leaving here until you kick me out or explain why you keep leaving me wondering where the hell you are?”

“Sorry.”

“That used to be enough, but not now. Not if you think the words, ‘I love you’ get you off the hook. I’m sick of loving a man who keeps disappearing and won’t love me back.”

“Love you.”

“Then you’ve got a horrible way of showing me.”

Scout wanted to explain but Jodi was pushed aside by heap of white coats checking charts, machines and treating him as an object rather than a patient. Bloody doctors, give him a sexy nurse any day to give him some bedside attention, especially if the nurse was Jodi. 

“Sorry doc, I don’t understand any of that medical mumbo jumbo. Will I live and how long before I can get back to work?”

“Yes, you’ll live,” finally the doctor had a sense of humor. “As for work, well we should be able to transfer you back to your own people later today and it will be up to them. That arm injury didn’t happen last night?”

“Nah, happened a month ago when a truck tried to roll on me. Thought it would fix itself.”

“Well, I’ve documented it now on your file, so I’m sure they’ll take care of it for you. Any other questions?”

“As long as I can have visitors, I’m good.”

“This lady here? None of my staff are paid enough danger money to try and remove her from your room. Apparently the two of you need to finish a conversation and this accident was your way of having the last say.”

Scout wasn’t the only one in the room who laughed. “Mate, you’ve met her, I’m never gonna get the last word in.”

Eventually, one of the staff removed his neck brace, checked his pillows and the room cleared, leaving Jodi standing next to his bed.

“You’d better refill those ice chips and take a seat, this might take a while.”

“So, talk to me,” she asked, feeding him more chips even though at least one of his arms was perfectly capable of doing it.

Suddenly, everything became real and if he said the words, they could never be taken back.

“I can’t.”

“Talk to me, I need to know about that bloody text message.”

“What do you think? I mean, we’ve always said ‘nothing serious’.”

“What if we were?” He could see the answer in her eyes even before her lips touched his good hand.

Scout took a massive leap of faith, after all what was the worse thing that could happen? “Then I’d have to say that I wasn’t thinking about the road or anything other than wanting to spend the rest of my life with you.” 

“No more games?”

“If you’re talking about the disappearing act, I never wanted you to know my secrets.”

“Why? Have you got a secret wife I don’t know about?”

“No but I have trouble sleeping when I’m not on base. I wake up in the sweats or screaming.”

“I know.”

“What?”

“I’ve known for a while. Every now and then you drop off asleep, wake up startled and start calling out. Usually if I can get to you in time, all I have to do is stroke your forehead and you go back to sleep straight away. Don’t you remember?”

“Nah, not at all.” He thought back. There had been some nights when he’d had the soundest sleep in her bed, but most of the time he left for her own good.

“Ric, why didn’t you tell me?”

“Because I didn’t want you to think I was some defective loser or have to tell the counsellors at the base hospital.”

“Most of the guys who have done a couple of tours have seen stuff that you don’t want to talk about and even if you did, we’d never understand. When you came back to my place, it was as a lover and not a patient. I’m not about to share anything we do or say at work.”

“Have I ever told you how much I bloody love you?” He had vague recollections of Jodi saying something about wanting a do-over while he struggled to keep his eyes open on the road. But the details were hazy, and he didn’t know whether she wanted him to say the words again, or to wait until she felt the same.

“I guess this is slightly more romantic than a text,” she leaned over so all he had to do was pull her the rest of the way and let his lips do the talking.

“I love you and life’s too short to wait until I can get out of here and organise something more romantic. Damn it woman, I want this thing to be serious enough that one day you’ll say that you love me too.”

“Babe,” her lips were only millimetres away. “I’ve always known that I love you, I was just waiting for you to catch up.
