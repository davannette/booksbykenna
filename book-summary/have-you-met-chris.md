Sometimes there are minor characters in my books that make us want more. Early this year, I asked my readers to tell me what they wanted for Alex MacFarlane from [The Uni Student](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076NRVM5M/ "The Uni Student"). The response to [Have You Met ... Alex]({{ site.baseurl }}/book-summary/have-you-met-alex.html "Have You Met ... Alex") blew me away.

Then in February, I published [Have You Met ... Scout]({{ site.baseurl }}/book-summary/have-you-met-scout.html "Have You Met ... Scout").

So in March, I asked my readers who they wanted for former politicial staffer Christopher Lowe from  [The Politician's Wife](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D67WJ1F/ "The Politician's Wife"). Political opponent or journalist? Here is the short but not sweet romance they asked for!

## Have you met ... Chris?

“It’s my pleasure to welcome the youngest political power couple to the studio.” Christopher Lowe tried not to cringe at the radio shock jock’s weak and overused joke. The last thing he needed to do was get Morrie Shelton off side. 

“For those of you who have escaped all the press surrounding this election, meet Christopher Lowe and Nicole Donovan. Neither of them are new to politics but this is their first election either of them are standing in their own right. Nicole, how about you tell my audience a little about yourself and why the most beautiful woman in the world should be elected to one of Australia’s state parliaments.”

Chris sat back and observed Nicole go through her well rehearsed response. She had the most graceful way of not rising to the bait about her looks. Yes, with her shoulder length platinum blonde hair and long tanned legs, Nicole would have been at home on any catwalk, but here she was. As articulate as she was photogenic. In any other race, if her party had put her up against a middle-aged white male, the poor guy wouldn’t have stood a chance. Journalists loved her and she gave them great and original copy, every day.

Whether it was luck or intentional, his party had moved him across town to settle him in as a new “local” and pitted him up against Nicole for his first taste of the front line. Tall, dark and with the solid body of a man who’d had held his own on the football field, Chris played on the raw masculinity that men appreciated and the female voters loved. As expected, the media lapped it and since day one, they had each become the “face” of the election. 

“What about you, Chris, you’ve been in the background working for Minister James Dawson. Why now and why you?”

Like Nicole had before, Chris’ response was delivered rote with well practiced inflections and jokes.

“It’s easy to stand on the sidelines and demand change, expect that governments should do something. What I’ve learnt by working so closely with James Dawson and other members of parliament, is change only happens when it’s driven by the people. I was encouraged to stand by local people who know me and trust that I do what I say.”

“That’s all very well and good,” Nicole broke in, and Chris was taken back. They’d done a dozen joint interviews before and had fallen into a patter of shared minutes in the spotlight, but this was the first time she’d interrupted. “What exactly would you bring to the table other than tall, dark and handsome looks and a pedigree of being James Dawson’s fixer?”

“Well, she’s got you there,” Morrie leaned into the microphone, smelling blood. Luckily, Chris had been trained by the best.

“If good looks were going to be a barrier to good policies, then I’m afraid Ms Donovan would be easily disqualified. Thank you for the complement, and Ms Donovan is right. I was James’ Chief of Staff for a number of years. I demonstrated the level of loyalty and resilience that my constituents can expect me to pursue on their behalf.”

“I’m sure Susannah Dawson can give you a recommendation,” Nicole threw out. Chris tried to read her face, could she know? Surely not. They’d been discrete and in any case …

“What do you say, Chris? Would Susannah give you a recommendation?” Morrie pressed.

Chris thought quickly, if he called their bluff, the result would go viral.

“Let’s find out her,” he dialled a number he’d known off by heart for years. “Susannah, I’m with Morrie Shelton and if you don’t mind, I’ll put you live on air.”

“Mrs Dawson, Morrie Shelton here with Chris Lowe who you know and Nicole Donovan who wants to take him down at the ballot box.”

“Good morning Morrie, I don’t believe I’ve met Nicole before but I am a fan of her ability to raise the profile of housing affordability.”

Good on Susannah, she’d been a political wife for far too long not to let any opportunity go begging. Early on, Nicole had issued a statement contradicting her party’s position on housing affordability and now refused to answer any questions about it – which only ensured the topic never went away.

“I’d love to discuss that and any other topic with you after the election,” Nicole replied smoothly, her only tell of rising anxiety was the smoothing of her hair. Something for him to remember later. “What I’d love to know today is how close you and Chris were when he worked for your husband.”

“Political life is difficult on relationships and he was a good and trusted friend to both of us when James and I went through a rocky patch,” Susannah batted back. “I think the best way to describe Chris Lowe is that I trusted him implicitly. He’s been at my house so often that I think we all started setting a place for him at the table without thinking.” Quickly, without giving Nicole time to ask a follow up, Susannah continued, “My husband and I have known Chris Lowe for years and not only does my husband believe in him enough to recommend Chris within the party, I believe he will make a fine local representative.”

“That’s lovely to hear, Mrs Dawson, but what about his integrity,” Nicole showed her naivety in even asking the question. “I don’t think anyone doubts his commitment to you and the party, but I think there will always be questions about whether he can put the electorate first.”

Chris was about to respond when Susannah’s voice continued. “It’s because of Chris Lowe’s commitment to the Australian people that I have today written a personal cheque for fifty thousand dollars to the local MensLink charity. That’s because Chris convinced me that without an immediate injection, 630 men would go hungry next month. Knowing where the need is and going out of his way to fill it – that’s the sort of man Chris Lowe is.”

Damn she was good, Chris thought as Morrie took control of the interview and instead of it being about Nicole’s attempt to smear him with rumors, it became about men’s mental health.


“Great redirect, did you know?” Nicole asked him as they waited for their respective cars.

“We’d spoken about it, but I wanted her to sit on the governance board. It’s a good charity and every dollar is needed.”

“I agree and had planned visit there next week, I guess you trumped me.”

“What if we go together – no politics involved but put the issue on the agenda for both parties?”

“I like you, Christopher Lowe,” why did her laugh affect him so? “But I don’t trust you.”

“Thank you, I think.”

“Word of advice, if you want those rumors to die a natural death, you should find yourself a Mrs Lowe.”

“The thing is, Ms Donovan,” he emphasised her title, “I’ve seen what politics can do to a marriage and I’d never expose a woman I love to political life.”

“Oh, I think that’s what women love about you,” Nicole giggled as her car arrived. “You are so innocent that you actually believe you can control who you love!”


“We meet again,” Nicole’s smile seemed genuine as she greeted him at another school parents’ meeting.

“I see the press still follow your every move,” he replied, knowing the photographers were always looking for them to make a mistake. An awkward or hateful glance. The problem is, the more he got to know Nicole, the less there was to dislike. 

“Actually, if you count the ratio of women to men, I think they’re here to see you.”

“There’s no camera nearby, you can stop with the false flattery.”

“Who says it’s false,” she winked at him before leaving to greet the school principal.

Nicole was getting harder to ignore, not just because he had to study every move and listen to every word so he could counter her arguments; but because she was simply taking his breath away. Those blue eyes had him enthralled, especially when they looked at him as if he was the only person in the world. Most politicians had to learn the art of charisma and how to pretend to care. For Nicole, it came as naturally as breathing. Stop it, he chided himself, he could be bloody well writing her campaign material!

“Mr Lowe, so good of you to join us,” Mrs Compton led Nicole back to him. “Our school is very honoured to have both candidates present this evening. I do have to warn you that there are some high school students in the crowd so I would ask you keep your comments civil.”

“Mrs Compton, I might have a lot to say about Mr Lowe’s politics, but you’ll find that he is a complete gentlemen and I promise you that neither of us will do anything to offend your parents or students.” Nicole was so sincere that Chris could only stand back and marvel. He didn’t have a bloody chance with her talking on behalf of both of them, and what could he say – that he had every intention of going hard and talking over the top of her if necessary to make a point?

“You ready?” James Dawson, his mentor and former friend shook his hand for any waiting cameras, fake smile plastered.

“You know I am. Why are you here?”

“The party thinks you need more grunt. The two of you are dancing around and while the press are lapping it up, your job is to win votes not hearts.”

“Mr Dawson,” a local journalist interrupted them in full fangirl mode. Chris could see that James hadn’t lost any of his charm but lucky for Susannah, he wasn’t taking advantage of it anymore. “Are you here to babysit your protégé?”

“Ah,” James answered smoothly, “Does Chris Lowe look like a man that needs a babysitter?” James’ innuendo was clear. “It will be a while before the place fills up, why don’t you take Chris somewhere quiet and ask him all the questions you want.”

Chris followed the journalist to an empty classroom to the watchful gaze of Nicole. As young and inviting as the journalist appeared, he had no intention of doing anything stupid just for good press, surely Nicole knew that?

“Are you going to see her again?” Nicole murmured as the room cleared at the end of another successful debate. Neither of them had lost, but there were no clear winners, either.

“Who?” The only bloody woman he couldn’t stop thinking about was standing in front of him.

“I assume you at least asked that journalist for her name before you swept her off for a quickie,” Nicole answered too quickly and with a faint hint of jealousy.

Confused and offended, before he could stop himself, Chris countered, “Is that how you get the good press, a quick romp with a journalist in some dirty back room and hope he remembers how to spell your name in the morning?”

The slap echoed across the almost empty room. Within half an hour the video footage had been posted online. The next day, all anyone wanted to talk about was what had triggered such an uncharacteristic moment.

“Could you have been any more stupid?” James railed, storming into his unit without even a “good morning.” “For goodness sake, you have one job. Turn up, turn on the charm and charm them into voting for you. That’s it.”

“I don’t want to talk about it.”

“I don’t care what you want or don’t want, the party doesn’t care. The voters care and right now whoever gives them the story first sets the narrative and wins.”

“Give me a second,” Chris fled to his bedroom and dialled Nicole’s number. They’d exchanged contact information early on in the campaign in case they needed to bypass their teams. This was the first time he’d used it. 

“Nicole Donovan, good morning,” her voice was like summer rain. He wondered what lucky man would wake to those words, then pushed the thoughts aside. Could it have been his own jealousy that triggered his stupid statement last night?”

“Ms Donovan, Chris Lowe,” he paused.

“Mr Lowe, you certainly know how to create a trending meme.”

“I can’t take all the credit. Are you alone?”

Nicole laughed and he heard the sound of a door close, “I’m surrounded by people who want to take advantage of last night and milk it for all it’s worth.”

“What reason did you give them?”

“I haven’t. The way I remember our conversation, I questioned your integrity and you questioned mine.”

“Are you recording this conversation?” he had to ask.

“No, are you?”

“I’d like to apologize to you in person, no cameras. Just an honest apology and a heartfelt admission that I’ve never thought you have or would use your sensuality to get a headline.”

“I think you just did.”

“What?” he was totally confused by this woman who intrigued and frustrated the hell out of him.

“You just apologized, and I most humbly accept. But how about we meet up where people can take photos but can’t hear. The story will be how we are both big enough not to air private squabbles in public.”

“I like that, our parties will trust us and the public will think we are adult enough to vote for.”

“Not one vote will change from last night, but at least we’ll force the press to move on.”

“Nic,” he’d never shortened her name before.

“Yeah?”

“It’d be easier to beat you if I didn’t like you so much.”

Again, that beautiful shimmer of a laugh, “I’ll text you an address and we can talk about all the ways I’d like to beat you.”

Did she mean that? Chris had no idea how much of her recent flirting was real and how much was intentionally messing with his head. Yes, he had been attracted to her from before they met and the more time they spent together, the easier it seemed.

“You took long enough,” James growled as Chris’ phone buzzed. 

“Let the press follow me and in an hour last night will be old news.”

“The party is meeting this morning, they’re going to want a greater control over your publicity from here on. They’ve asked me to pick your press agent and I’m giving you Thomas Coe. He’s young and the son of a party friend.”

“I don’t need one, I can get all the press I want on my own.”

“Chris, if you want to get elected, you need to start saying what we want and when we want it. You are part of a machine now and it’s about time you adulted up and accepted your place. You are a pawn. Nothing more and nothing less; and since I nominated you – you are my pawn.”

One thing was clear, James would never forgive or forget.


Her legs visible under the table, shoes kicked off as if she was about to relax with friends, Nicole was waiting for him with two coffees. For the cameras who were clicking furiously from outside the closed café, they shook hands, smiled and sat opposite each other.

“Do you think they’ve got any lip-readers out there?” Nicole asked without even motioning to the waiting sharks.

“Probably, but if we try to cover our faces, that will be the story,” Chris spoke with his lips barely moving. “I’m really sorry for what I said.”

“Me too, I guess I was a little jealous,” Nicole blushed. “I didn’t mean jealous of another woman being with you, but jealous that if you wanted to, you could go off, have a quickie and no one would judge you for it.”

“I’ve only ever loved one other woman. It didn’t work and I don’t have the time to try again.”

“Can I guess who?”

“I’d rather you didn’t, because I don’t like lying and I’ve never been the kind of guy to kiss and tell.”

“She was a fool not to choose you.”

“I’m sure she doesn’t think so. But what about you? I might have been a prick for how I said it, but you’d have to have men offering you anything for a second glance.”

“Haven’t you read my press? Apparently, intelligent women can’t get men, and the best way of being a celibate intelligent woman is to be intimidatingly beautiful as well.” 

“I read that article, I wouldn’t take any notice of it,” Chris consoled. “If the world had more women like you, it would be a better place.”

“Wow,” she sat back in shock, maybe she wasn’t used to men being honest? “It’s really difficult not to like you.”

“Thank you, I think.”

Chris refused to finish the last sip of his coffee. Once he did, there’d be no more reason to stay and this had been the best conversation they’d had, ever.

“My party wants me to go dirty,” he admitted.

“That seems to be the consensus. My party is waiting for you to make the move and then we’ll counter.”

“I wish there was another way.”

“Well, if you kept it on the policies, you’d lose,” her eyes twinkled with a challenge he couldn’t resist.

“I don’t think so,” he teased. “We are stronger on the economy and education.”

“Really?”

The photographers outside gradually fell away as they talked through each of their party’s policies. Surprisingly, their personal views were closer to the centre and agreement than they thought.

“I guess that’s why it is so damn difficult to debate you,” Nicole finally stood to leave. 

“That and you are so damn beautiful that half the time I struggle to find words to string together,” he hoped it came across as charming rather than the truth it was.

“If only you were good looking, you’d wipe the floor with me,” she returned fire with a cheeky smile.

“One of these days, I’d like to …” he started, breaking off before he went too far.

“Yeah, me too.”

This time a lone camera caught Nicole kissing him on the same cheek she’d slapped the night before. Social media had a field day and all the policies announced by their parties were lost in the noise of the photo.



“Do you need anything else, boss?” Laura asked, no longer able to hide her yawn. Behind her, the rest of his team stood back hopeful that he wouldn’t have “one more idea” for them to work up into a new article or press release or even social media campaign by morning. A month into the campaign and he could see the signs of the early adrenalin running out. Either he gave them time off now or some of the youngsters might crash and burn in the final week when he’d need them at their best.

“Go, get some sleep. How about we all take the morning off and I’ll see you after lunch,” he looked at the time. “Go on, I’m giving you almost eighteen hours without me.”

“But what if …” Laura gave a half protest before he cut her off.

“The campaign still has another two weeks to go. Get some sleep, see if your families still recognise you or if you’ve got friends who will buy you a well-deserved drink.”

“Thanks,” Laura was the first to give him a hug. They’d all become like family and while they might call him “boss” when no one was around, it might as well have been an affectionate, “brother.”

After his team organised share cars to head back to the city, Chris felt their absence more than he expected and the last thing he wanted to do was face a lonely hotel room. They were only an hour from home but it made sense to hire a room close to wherever they were spending the day to refresh and regroup when needed. Chris had booked a late checkout for tomorrow, but right now he was too wired to sleep.

“Hey, stranger!” a familiar voice greeted him at the bar. “Scotch and coke for me, and whatever my enemy is having,” Nicole laughed her order to the barman.

“Enemy?”

“You annihilated me today! I hope you paid your speech-writer extra for those gags.”

“Thomas is doing a good job, but it helped that your party released a stupid policy.”

“Perhaps if the voters elect me, I’ll be able to change that!”

“Well, you deserve a drink,” Chris handed over his credit card before she had a chance. “Allow me.”

“What have you done with your entourage?” She looked around at the almost deserted bar. If he wanted company, he would have looked for crowds, but he had purposely searched out a small bar with carpet older than the barman. Never thinking that Nicole would find him.

“Gave them the night and morning off. As you said, we kicked butt today, they deserve to go off and celebrate.”

“Same minds think alike,” she mused. “Mine were devastated, not just at the way the policy was announced, but because somehow the email came through while I was already speaking. It seems your team got it before mine.”

“Things happen,” he shrugged. He could probably guess which journalist was hedging his bets and had traded an inside scoop for a future one.

“Well, thanks for the drink, but its probably not a good look for me to be drinking with my enemy.” As Nicole got up to leave, he reached out but pulled away before touching her arm.

“Nic, wait. It’s been a long day and I don’t know about you, but I’m still too wired to sleep. I’ve got a room upstairs. How about you give me fifteen minutes to buy us a bottle of something good to drink, go upstairs and tidy up and we just …” he let his eyes finish the sentence. Their flirting had started to border on obscene when no one was around. In two weeks, the votes would have been cast and they might never have another chance.

“I thought you’d never ask. How about I bring the food.”

“You know the way to my heart.”

“For a start,” she smiled. “Good thing there aren’t cameras around now.”

“Why?”

“Because I’d never want to explain to the public what I’m thinking.”

“Then explain it to me, later,” he scribbled his room number on a coaster.

It took all his effort not to turn around and see her once more as he left with a bottle of red. She was gone by the time he returned and got a bottle of scotch as well. He preferred wine, but she’d ordered a scotch. For Nic, he could be flexible and agile – in his choice of drink and in any other way she chose!


Nicole had stopped thinking about the consequences the moment she walked past the dingy bar and saw Chris alone with a drink in hand. It had become harder to hide the giddy way he made her feel. All the thoughts of wiping the political floor with her opponent, no matter who they threw at her disappeared the moment their eyes met before they first shook hands. Yes, he was charismatic in posters and on TV, but nothing had prepared her for losing all conscious and coherent thought when he first took her hand. Not in an over-powering, alpha male way, but a firm handshake between equals. 

At first when she started dropping the innuendos, he parried back with style until their flirting had become almost a hidden language. Why, just the other day, they were part of a debate with the other candidates, having their own conversation about the size of plastic coffee cups and the impact on the environment. Yes, there was a level of policies, but when she asked what he considered an acceptable size, she was able to do it with such a straight face that only Chris knew exactly what she meant. 

“Whatever it takes to get the job done and not leave you wanting more.”

Tonight, she wanted to know.

Nicole, still dressed in the classic suit she had worn all day didn’t even have to knock before the door opened and Chris pulled her inside.

“You know what they say about the campaign trail,” he cupped her face in his hands, lips almost touching.

“What?” she breathed, stunned that he actually felt the same.

“What happens on the campaign trail, stays on the campaign trail.”

“Has anyone told you that you talk too much?” Nicole didn’t wait for an invitation, pressing her open lips against his.

The first kiss was so tentative, playful as their mouths danced, finding each other’s rhythm.

“Wow,” she sighed, coming up for air and hoping his heart was racing as fast as her own.

“I’ve got a bottle of wine,” Chris suggested.

“I don’t need it,” Nicole removed her jacket and folded it over the single desk chair on the far side of the room, unable to ignore the large bed that took up most of the floor space. “But I’ll join you, if you do.”

“We haven’t really done anything that we can’t explain,” Chris removed his own jacket and tie, never losing her gaze.

Nicole started helping him with his shirt buttons, brushing the shirt open to reveal a tanned chest rippling with muscles she knew would be there, after all she’d had hours to examine him during debates while letting her imagination go to places that made her blush. “If you gave the female voters a look at this, I wouldn’t stand a chance.”

“Perhaps you’d better check my abs to make sure they’re real. Politician’s don’t have a reputation for honesty.” Chris teased, starting his own exploration, lifting her skirt. Involuntarily, she pressed her hips against his, feeling far more than she bargained for.

“Is that all, coffee cup?” She hesitated with her fingers still playing with his chest.

“Why don’t you find out and let me know if you think it’ll be up to the job,” Chris offered her a challenge she couldn’t refuse.

One more second, that’s all it would take for him to turn her away and they’d never have to speak of this again. Nicole held back for the count of three before reaching behind and dropping her skirt to the floor. Chris pushed her back onto the bed, covering her body with everything she’d been waiting for. Kisses upon kisses until she thought she couldn’t breath, only to find herself naked in his arms.

“You are …” he whispered with his tongue flicking around her neck. “Absolutely. Positively. Exquisite.”

Releasing him from the trousers and briefs, Nicole could only marvel at his size. “It’s all coffee cup!”

“It’s all yours.”

“Do you have anything?” She asked, not wanting him to say “yes” which could mean this was a set up, but also not wanting him to say, “no”.

“Good point,” and Chris spun around until her hips were pressed against his face. Within seconds she didn’t care this wasn’t what she expected, opening herself to him and taking him at the same time. Not feeling him in the ways she wanted but being pleasured in ways she’d long forgotten how.

Such closeness and trust that she shouldn’t be feeling the first time, but Chris felt so right, and Nicole only wanted to give back as much as he was giving her. 

Oh, he was good.

Not only did he know what to do, but how to drive her wild with desire by changing up the pressure and intensity.

Finished but not satisfied, they crashed back side by side. “That was, not bad,” she teased. 

“How about you open the bottle of wine and I’ll get a box of ‘things’ from my car,” Chris sat up and grabbed some old shorts and a top from the floor. “The first week of the campaign, my team gave me half a dozen boxes of condoms as half gag and half to protect me from being photographed buying them.”

“They went that far?”

“Every now and then, they count the boxes and joke that I must be topping them up because no political candidate can go a whole campaign without getting laid.”

“Glad to help you out,” her voice caught. Chris Lowe was so much more than that, at least to her.

“Sweet Nic,” he brushed away her fears. “I promise you are my one and only obsession. If I couldn’t take my eyes off you before, how do you think I’m going to go now I know how sweet you taste,” he teased, leaning in for more kisses.

“Go,” she pushed him away laughing. “Go, before we start something I don’t want to stop.”


He’d been unprepared for their first time, but the second and third were executed to perfection. Nicole’s banter was as much as turn on as the way she lay on the bed, greeting him with a filled wine glass held between her legs.

“I don’t even know where to begin?” Quickly removing the clothes that had been necessary for self modesty in the dash to his car, Chris started kissing at her toes, working his way up to the glass. Carefully, he dipped his tongue in the red liquid then reached up to cover her nipple. Again and again he transferred droplets of wine until her nipples glistened a light stain of red.

“Either drink it or lose it,” Nicole sighed, swirling the glass around before he finished it and got rid of all distractions.

“I want this, with you.” Chris said, crawling up her body until she had no choice but to share his gaze. “I want this.”

All his doubts between right and wrong disappeared the moment she gasped as his fingers went to work, teasing and playing. He tried building her slowly, but as she responded to his touch, Chris only wanted more, flicking her bud until a writhing Nicole cried out, “Now, please, now.”

This. This was the moment he had wanted, never believing she would truly feel the same. Slowly he felt their bodies coming together as one. Sliding in with only the faintest resistance, Nicole’s eyes widened as she adjusted for his size.

“You okay?” he asked in between kisses.

“What do you think?” she said, wrapping her legs tightly around his waist. Kisses upon kisses, her nails made trails along the full length of his back. 

“Ahh,” he cried.

“Can’t handle me?” she teased.

“At least I’m prepared to learn.” Holding her hips firm, Chris worked his way around her body, matching all her sensitive spots to her different cries.

“Now, please, now,” this time when she cried, her hips rose to meet him with the full force of her passion. Every thrust, long and deep until her shudder came as a surprise and he quickly joined her.


Chris’ hands were still shaking when he poured them each another glass of wine. “I’ve never felt this connected, so quickly,” he admitted.

“It’s not as if we just met and hooked up. We’ve practically been living together since the campaign started,” Nicole nuzzled into his naked chest.

“So, now you’ve had your way with me, do you think you’d be up to staying the night?”

“You mean I’d have to see your bed hair tomorrow morning?” Nicole laughed as he self-consciously ran his hands through the dark fringe.

“If I can handle the scratches, surely you can handle my hair.”

“Let me see.” To his great delight, Nicole’s passion knew no bounds and needed minimal recovery time. Luckily, he needed minimal sleep.


Hoping her staff would blame her smile on a good night’s sleep, Nicole rushed into her team meeting just as it was about to start. No one commented on the new pale pink blouse – purchased on her way – or the fact that she clung to her coffee as if it was keeping her alive.

Christopher Lowe. Even the thought of his name invoked memories of passion and the glaze across his eyes just before he came. Wow. Last night had been far more than she expected and even though questions about the future weren’t asked, she woke with no regrets.

“This isn’t the end,” Chris had told her as she kissed him at the door. 

“This isn’t going to be easy,” she had warned him as much as herself.

“Nothing worthwhile ever is.”



“Mr Lowe,” the cocky young student had sauntered up to the microphone as Chris tried to anticipate the question. Well presented with an air of entitlement. Chris flicked through his statistics on environmental policy and gender equality. 

“In an environment where our local youth unemployment is at over thirty five percent and in a community where we have already buried three high school students this year from suicide, what will you do in your first 100 days to address what should be a national debate.”

Damn.

The cheering ovation from the student body and parents who were seated in the back gave him time to think. Neither his advisors or the party had prepared him for this question. Looking over at Nicole, she wasn’t even going through her papers. Would she wing it or was she better prepared?

“First, can I say how sorry I am for the loss of your friends,” he cautiously started.

“With all due respect, and I mean none at all, you can shove your pity. We need action. Our lives depend on it.”

The problem with youth was they saw things in black and white and Chris had been around politics too long to believe in cookie cutter solutions.

“As you pointed out, there seems to be a correlation between high unemployment and the desperate measures some people take …” Chris talked off-the-cuff for a couple of minutes, finishing up and sitting down as soon as the young man started to fidget. 

“Ms Donovan, I hope you can give me more than just political mumbo jumbo,” the young man quickly dismissed Chris.

Nicole surprised everyone by slowly leaving the stage, walking down the aisle with all eyes on her. Chris could have heard a pin drop as she stood for the briefest of seconds before embracing the young man at the microphone. In an instant, the cockiness evaporated, and he started sobbing in her arms. Chris could only watch as one by one other students joined the collective embrace.

“I don’t have any answers,” Nicole said from the floor with her hands held out in an open embrace. “But I’m sure you do. I’m sure that if we come together, business leaders, educators, parents and are willing to be lead by young leaders like you, we can come up with the answers.”

“I’ll be in that,” the young man sobbed.

“I’m counting on it. Here’s my number and I want you to get in touch. I’m not going to give you fluffy and meaningless mumbo jumbo that’s going to be forgotten the moment I get back to party headquarters.” The whole room followed her gaze up to Chris, alone on the stage with the moderator while Nicole stood on the ground, surrounded by her new fans. “Whether I win or not, I am making a personal, not political commitment to you. I will come back here, bring with me whomever is willing to be part of the conversation. We need to listen to why people are feeling like there is only one option. Get in touch with me and we will make it happen.”

It wasn’t until the party had watched endless replays of the segment that Chris agreed, Nicole looked too composed and ready for the question. Had it been a plant? He didn’t doubt the sincerity of her response, but the whole thing seemed staged. Leaving the kid to be the last question and having so many of his friends close to the microphone to make the spontaneous hug possible.

“You went too soft on her,” seemed to be the consensus. How could he have torn her apart after spending the last two nights together in stolen passion.

“She knows exactly what she’s doing, even down to letting you answer most of the questions first.” Chris didn’t want to think the whole night had been planned, but there was plenty of time for him to watch recaps and replays across all news and social media.

Then there was her look. The eyes that had him surrender in bed made minced meat of him in public. Replay after replay and he could pin point the exact second she crushed his heart and fed it back to him. His new screen saver became the withering look Nicole gave him from the floor.

Could every kiss have been a lie? Did politics mean that much that she had been willing to sleep with him just to mess with his head?



The school hall debate started a new tradition; whomever won the debate had to arrange the next date. Since they couldn’t be seen in public, Nicole needed to come up with an idea that was as spectacular as her performance on stage. Her team had warned her that the school newsletter had recently dedicated a whole issue to the collective grief of the community. The media didn’t like reporting on youth suicide which was why Chris had been caught unawares. 

This campaign would only be won by stringing together well researched events, not that she didn’t believe in everything she had said.

“Hi honey, I’m home!” Chris let himself inside with the spare key. 

“In the kitchen,” Nicole placed the spicy chicken gozleme in between the sandwich press. The owner of her favorite café had assured her they only needed five minutes to reheat. The lamb shanks in rich tomato sauce and potatoes were all done, only needing another half an hour in the pressure cooker to be perfect. 

“To the victor,” Chris swung her around, bottle of scotch in hand. 

“To my worthy opponent,” Nicole pulled back, pretending to check on the food, but really so she could get the full impact of casual Chris. Gone were the tailored suit and shirts, replaced with a tight-fitting sports t-shirt and shorts. “Seriously, how am I supposed to think about food when you’re standing there looking so …” 

“Hungry?” He laughed at her. “You promised me food and I refuse to be distracted by your body.”

“I can’t work out if that’s a challenge or a warning?” Linking her hands around his waist, Nicole’s lips found his. “You could give a girl a clue, kiss me again like that and I’m taking you straight to bed.”

“Won’t dinner be ruined?” Chris asked, kissing her again before she could answer.

“How about we see if you can do two things at once?” she teased, quickly plating the gozleme and leading Chris to the bedroom. The only thing she loved more than their passionate debates, was their unbridled passion.

Hot. Fast. Furious.

Nicole had never had a lover with so many speeds. He could build her to a frenzy and then edge her until she lay screaming for more. Then, he changed gears again and made love as if she was the only woman in the world.

Tender, slow and loving.

No! 

She couldn’t be falling in love with him, despite how bloody perfect he seemed. 

“So, what’s for dessert?” Chris asked as licked pastry crumbs from her stomach.

“Funny boy! Slow cooked lamb.”

“I should have known my girl likes her meat.”

“You should see me rip it off the bone!”

“Gentle, isn’t it enough that you ripped me at the school?”

“Oh, that!” she swung around to get out of bed. “That was me being gentle.”


Each day he woke up and promised that last night would be the last time. Except then he’d roll over, take one look at Nicole’s blonde hair spread across the pillow and want one more day. 

Forced to spend most days and evenings together trying to destroy each other in community hall after school hall after hospital and anywhere else their teams had decided to organise, they fell into a pattern of attacking the politics on stage and the body in private. Trying to find a balance in the chaos of personal and professional lives.

Chris still couldn’t believe that this goddess had turned everything he thought he wanted and knew on its head.

“When are we going to talk about the future?” he asked over a game a chess, which she beat him at quite convincingly.

“Did you imagine this two months ago?” Nicole had asked, setting up for another game. 

“Of course not.”

“Then how are we supposed to imagine what its going to be like in two months time. The polls are so close that we don’t know which party is going to win, let alone which one of us.”

“Eventually, we are going to run out of board games and movies; the real world awaits.”

“Fine, then how about we call the next press conference at our breakfast table and see how that works out for both of us,” she snorted. 

“Keep beating me at chess, and I might just do that.”

“Promises, promises.”

Still, they couldn’t keep hiding forever, but was what they were building strong enough to survive the public glare? Chris didn’t want to find out. Right now, they had to be satisfied with trying to destroy each other by day and enjoy each other by night.



“Have you seen the press yet?” Jessa, Nicole’s press secretary woke her at five. Nicole rolled away from Chris to take the call in his lounge room, turning on the TV and rubbing her eyes until the breakfast news came into focus.

“No, what happened?”

“The esteemed Christopher Lowe just got as low as any son of a bitch could have possibly gone,” Jessa was so angry that her words were falling one over another. “I mean, he must have been desperate to win to put out such scum. Is there anything the bastard wouldn’t do?”

“Slow down, I can’t see anything, oh wait.”

Nicole closed the bedroom door and came back to turn up the volume.

“What I think it says is that society still questions the role that women have in public debate which is appalling, and Chris Lowe should apologise immediately not only to Nicole Donovan but every other single woman.” The female announcer was quite heated in her views, but Nicole needed to know what the hell Chris had said.

“Read it to me,” she closed her eyes, hoping the words were being sensationalised for air time and click bait.

“Most politicians accept that their responsibilities are twenty-four hours a day and often seven days a week. To do the role justice, they must be one hundred percent committed. Mr Lowe has demonstrated this commitment through almost a decade of public service including Chief of Staff to a government minister. Ms Donovan’s commitment to the electorate must be considered within the context of her future ambitions. Does she see herself abandoning those who would trust and vote for her by stepping aside for marriage and children? Or does Ms Donnovan believe she can dedicate herself 100 per cent to the electorate whilst also giving 100 per cent to raising a future family?”

“Is it really signed by Chris Lowe?”

“Yep, I got a copy within half an hour of it hitting all the press desks. The media are already lapping it up and are looking for a response.”

“Do I need to clear the response through the party?”

“I’ve got a couple of calls in, but I reckon we get you in a studio this morning and fill the airwaves with positive feminist media grabs. Go at him hard and turn it back.”

“I can’t believe he’d do this to me!”

“Politics is never personal, until it is,” Jessa sighed. “How soon can I get you on camera?”

“Give me half an hour to have a coffee and then start lining up the radio stations. I think a joint press conference with the party leader will get the best mileage.”

Nicole watched another interview with an expert who spewed crap about how unfair it was for women to have to defend themselves, before detailing the case for women to stay at home with their knitting! A quick search online and she realized that Chris had put her at the centre of a feminist debate that she couldn’t win. Either she’d come across as a barren, career driven woman who would give up her femininity for politics, or she’d be viewed as only running for office until a sexy man came along to be father to her future children.

How could he do this to her? Especially after last night when he had ordered a three-course meal to be delivered to celebrate only one week to go.

Silently, she grabbed her clothes and hand bag, escaping before he even stirred. Nicole had never felt so used, ashamed or even betrayed. Up until this morning, she’d even started to think in terms of “love” when trying to define her feelings for Chris and had a thousand different ways they could make their relationship real after the polls closed.

Jessa had emailed her the full press release before she’d gotten to her car. It read harsher than it sounded over the phone. Angry tears turned defiant. Chris might have used her, softened her up for this attack hoping she’d never recover in time; but he couldn’t be more wrong. Sucking in oxygen, Nicole thought back to their nights together, all the different ways he’d made her body come alive. From their first kiss, all the nerves and anxiety about campaigning had gone away and she had never slept so soundly than after being completely and utterly satisfied in his bed.

Used. 

No! She refused to feel that way. Refused to feel the victim, not when …” For safety’s sake, Nicole pulled over into a side street to cry the only tears she ever wanted to shed over Christopher Lowe. The last thing she needed was to have to explain a car accident half a block from his house while still dressed in the clothes from yesterday. 

Damn, she’d left a new suit hanging in his wardrobe, and her makeup and hairstyling equipment in his bathroom. In an affair based on stolen minutes, she’d intended on staying in bed for as long as possible before going off to the aged care facility.

By the time Nicole arrived for her first radio interview, she had a plan – an aged care facility would be filled with older women who would state the case on her behalf. Three radio interviews and then she’d feed Chris to the aging lionesses! 

“It wasn’t me,” his text read.

Nicole couldn’t think of something polite to say, so she said nothing at all – at least to him.


“Who the hell thought it would be a good idea?” Chris stormed at his team.

“Boss, if you let me explain, we have a plan …” Thomas Coe started. Stupid young twerp who should have been interning at daddy’s law firm instead of fucking up his life.

“What plan is that – to alienate half of the voters?”

“The women don’t like her anyway because she’s pretty, young and ambitious. The focus groups see her as a threat. This will reinforce that view and consolidate your appeal amongst male voters.”

“You’re a bloody idiot. Did you even clear it with the party?”

“I didn’t have to, it went out under your name as an opinion, not theirs.”

“I’m going to be spending the rest of the week doing damage control,” he yelled, thinking that only half of the damage was to his career. Nicole hadn’t returned his texts or answered his calls. He knew that they were only supposed to call each other in the case of an emergency, surely this counted.

“Or you could let the comments stand and redirect back to policy. Everyone wants to talk to you today, it’s up to you what you say.”

“Sorry would probably be a start.”

“If you do that, you might as well kiss your balls good bye. The party might not be happy with the press release, but they’ll like the publicity and forgive you as long as you stand by your words. If you start apologizing then the voters won’t respect you and will never trust that you stand for anything.”

“I didn’t write it. I don’t even believe it.”

“You don’t have to tell anyone the truth, just bask in the glow.” Chris wanted to smack the stupid grin from Thomas’ face. Damn.


After counsel from the party who were also ropeable but at least took Thomas off his team, Chris took every interview and after issuing a standard line, “This electorate deserves someone who will be committed to them for the long haul,” he then redirected towards a new funding announcement that the party had bought forward to smother the news. He still had a political career, but at the expense of love.

Damn, he’d meant to use the “L” word last night after dessert, but when they ended up eating it in bed, he’d gotten distracted by the insatiable Nicole. He wanted the first time he said it to be special, not caught up in the heat of passion, and not wait until after voting had closed. The polls were on a knife’s edge and he didn’t want to tell her after winning; yet saying them after losing seemed even worse.

He loved Nicole. Even the thought made him smile. Yes, he could see her as a mother, balancing a thousand responsibilities including her electorate. Yes, he could see her beating him and probably deserved to do so. Years of putting in the hours, building returnable favors and street credibility had all been for this shot at a seat, but at what cost?

Chris unlocked the front door to her unit trying to convince himself that if she didn’t want him to use her spare key, she would have moved it.

“Nic,” he’d barely got the word out before she shoved him back towards the door.

“You bastard.”

“It wasn’t me, I promise and the guy who wrote and published it is gone.”

“Gone?” she snorted. “As in fired with no reference or hiding in party headquarters.”

“You know that I can’t fire him before the election, he’ll go straight to the press and they’ll love to use a disgruntled former staffer.”

“Right, I guess you can’t punish him if he was really taking orders from you.”

“Nic, please.”

“Don’t ‘Nic’ me, don’t call me and don’t treat me like an idiot.” Her calmness was like an ice pick to his heart.

“Nic, think about it. In what way have I ever shown that I think like that? Your team must have done its research on me – have I ever put out a press release for anyone that goes that low or says anything like those words?”

“That’s not the point. Last night was amazing, romantic and I went to sleep thinking that I loved you enough to try and figure out a future after polling day.”

“I love you, too,” he cried, trying in vain to hug her. Instead, she held open the door.

“Firstly, I don’t believe you but its nice to know how low you’ll stop when you’re caught out. Secondly, get out of my house and get the hell out of my life.”

“Nicole, I should have had better control over my team and what they put out in my name. I’m so sorry.”

“Get out.”

“Nic, please, what will it take for you to forgive me?” he pleaded as the front door jammed against his foot.

“Hell to freeze over.”



Chris stood at the back of the Dawsons’ living room watching and listening as the party powers dissected his campaign and with it, his life. According to the polling, he was now a litmus test for just about every policy that could swing the whole election. Code for, if he failed, so would the party. Code for, if they didn’t get on top of the publicity mess that his team had created then they might as well concede defeat without the burden of asking the electorate to vote.

“Hey, turn it up,” Carol Jenkins the party secretary called as the vision of Nicole came on the screen. Chris looked to her eyes and body language, desperate for any clue; defiant chin with an undertone of sadness in her eyes. Nothing he could work with, at least on a personal level. It had only been two days and her absence in his life was already intolerable. How on earth had he lived for so many years without her, and now … he’d do anything if it would change her mind.

“Look at how she’s faking the hurt and indignation.”

“What a fucking actress, give her a medal and get her the hell off the stage.”

Chris couldn’t listen to any more abuse as one comment only fed on the previous. Thinking no one would notice, he ducked into the kitchen and pretended to drink a glass of water.

“Hi,” the gorgeous and now happily married Susannah Dawson joined him at the kitchen sink.

“Hi yourself,” luckily theirs had been a brief affair when her marriage temporarily imploded. James might say all had been forgiven, but no man could possibly act nonchalant after knowing his wife had been loved by another, hence throwing Thomas fucking Coe into his team. “Aren’t you supposed to be in the other room deciding whether my career can be saved?”

“I could say the same about you.”

“Yeah, well …” he flinched and turned away as Susannah reached out for a comforting hand on his shoulder. “Don’t, seriously, just don’t.”

“What happened?”

“Nothing.”

“Chris, no one can hear us, even though James will notice we’re missing any minute. I saw your face when you look at her. What happened.”

“Nothing,” he couldn’t hold out much longer.

“Once upon a time, you looked at me the same way.”

“Then let me fill in the dots for you. It ended the same way. Some bastard did something and I lost the woman I loved. First, James decided he could give up other women for you, then Thomas decided to issue a fucked-up and made-up press release in my name.”

“I’m so sorry, but better you find out now that she doesn’t have what it takes to ignore the press.”

“That’s such a bitch thing to say,” he spat. “Seriously, you wanted to know and now you want to rub my face in it?”

“Chris, you know that politics is hard enough on a relationship let alone if you’re on opposite sides.”

“But if you listen to what she believes in, we’re not really that opposite except for the parties we joined. We basically believe in the same things, we’d just go about them differently.”

“Still, the voters would never forgive either of you.”

“You don’t understand. I love her and she won’t even talk to me.”

“You thought you were in love with me.”

“I was, and if you remember, the only thing standing in our way was your ability to forgive James.”

Susannah couldn’t respond, instead getting a packet of chocolate biscuits from the fridge. “So, what did you do that was so unforgiveable?”

“She thinks I put out that press release.” He was putting his heart out on show, but instead of sympathy, Susannah laughed.

“Be honest with me, I know that Thomas is taking the fall for it, but it read so well that even I thought you put it out.” Susannah gave him the smile that he once weakened for. “Come on, you love her and need to beat her. Didn’t it occur to you that the best way would be to put it out and blame someone else? It was so well targeted and written, your signature move.”

“You’ve got no fucking idea,” he stifled the yell, not wanting anyone to come in and check on them. “I would never think those things about her – and she should have known better.”

“I thought you were joking, but you’re serious about this girl. How far did the two of you go?” Finally, Susannah stopped being wife of the Minister and turned back into one of his best friends. “Yes, you say you love her, but how far did the two of you go?”

“Far enough.”

“In your best-case scenario, what happens if you win?”

Chris thought back to all the discussions he and Nicole never had, “I’ll probably never see her again because she’ll always think I won unfairly.”

“What happens if she wins?”

“That’s the easiest question of all, I’ll beg her to take me back and I’ll support her to the hilt. I’ll be her stay at home husband, her Chief of Staff, her biggest supporter and James will hate me more than he did the day he found out about our affair.”

He felt nothing when Susannah leaned up and kissed his cheek, “Then why don’t you tell her.”

Chris couldn’t go back into the room and listen to them talk smack about Nicole, it would be bad enough being their mouthpiece for the last two days of the campaign. The only thing they all agreed on was no more joint speaking opportunities or interviews.

Forty-eight hours later while smiling and going through the motions of photos and throwing out news grabs, Chris planned his last move, knowing how easily it could blow up his career.

“Carol, we need to take the sting out of that bloody press release,” he rang the party secretary. She’d known him for years and owed him more than one favor.

“I agree, but what’s done is done and we’ll have to work out damage control after the votes are counted.”

“I have an idea, but you’ll need to organise it.”

“It would have to be good.”

“Use all your connections to find out where and when Nicole is casting her vote. I’ll turn up and the press won’t let her avoid the photo opportunity. Either they capture the moment she is too scared to face me, or they get the photo of us together.”

“I don’t know,” she still didn’t sound convinced. 

In desperation, he continued, “Think about it, we get a photo of her ignoring me, that we can use later – you know that the public don’t accept churlish behaviour. Or there is a photo of us together and the bad vibes of the last seventy-two hours evaporates, and we can start with a clean slate. If it is marketed as news then we should get at least six hours of cut through.”

“Now you’re talking. No one turns up to vote at the same booth and time as their enemy. It could be marketing genius or shred your political future into slivers that can never be glued back together. Are you really ready to take that risk?”

“Right now, I’ve got nothing to lose,” he said more honestly than any political candidate could ever admit.


“Nicole, look this way!”

“Mr Lowe, over here!”

“Nicole, did you know he was going to be here today?”

“Ms Donovan, have you got anything to say to him?”

“Is this the first time you’ve spoken since the press release?”

Nicole hadn’t stopped shaking since the press swarmed around her as she entered the voting centre, waiting for “something” to happen. None of her team had been warned but all the cameras were primed but silent. They didn’t care about marking her name off the roll, or even as she took her place in line to cast her vote. Their excitement only peaked with an unseen arrival, heralded by Jessa’s, “Shit, I didn’t think he’d have the nerve.”

“No,” Nicole felt rather than heard her own soft cry as Chris came into view, full of the cocky charisma that had charmed her out of her clothes and mind. Damn him, she wanted to push her way to the front, vote and run as fast as she could out of sight and mind of the one man destined to be in her heart forever. No chance of her being distracted by marriage and babies, not after he stolen her heart and smashed it for the world to see; not that anyone would ever know that it had been anything other than political.

“Ms Donovan, I’m so glad to see you today,” Chris said for the cameras, adding softly, “You look beautiful.”

Two could play that game, Nicole tried to compose herself, extending her hand while smiling for the cameras that were almost blinding her with their flashes. “You don’t mind if I don’t wish you luck today,” to the laughs of the crowd. More softly and her head turned to avoid any lip reading, “This is a bastard act. I never wanted to see you in person again.”

“How about we both vote at the same time and show each other our voting slip,” Chris joked loudly with the faintest stroke of her hip. “I mean, voting may be secret, but I don’t think it shouldn’t be any secret who each of us is voting for. What do you say, Ms Donovan, one last photo for posterity?”

Nicole couldn’t decline, not with so many cameras waiting for any glimpse of her pain, instead she turned her back to him, grateful for the privacy of a vacated voting booth to make her selection.

All the reasons to mark a single “1” had been articulated in hundreds of venues and what felt like the same number of interviews. 

To hell with him, she marked her ballot paper and forced a smile as she returned to where Chris was already waiting.


All the planning came down to this moment. 

“Shall we show each other on the count of three?” he asked to her slight nod.

“One … two … three!”

Chris expected Nicole to be shocked at his voting slip, but what he was completely unprepared for was the mark on her paper. He only hoped none of the cameras caught the flicker of love before it disappeared again. He fumbled in folding the enormous ballot paper and took several attempts before stuffing it in the box.

“If it doesn’t fit, we could always get rid of it,” Nicole joked behind him.

“I’d rather not, what if the whole election relied on this vote?” he laughed.

“Then, how about you let me cast my vote to even up the score,” Nicole’s ballot slip disappeared within the box. 
Chris left the voting station with far more to think about than he expected. While thanking his volunteers, Nicole sent him a text.

“We should talk.”

“Please excuse me for a moment,” he quickly hugged the volunteers and moved away to where he couldn’t be overheard, a conversation as important as this couldn’t be put at risk by the misunderstandings of text. “Where? My day is planned down to the minute and I guess yours is as well.”

“My campaign celebration is in the hotel next to yours, you booked one day earlier so we got second best.”

“Have you got a room?”

“Yes, but it would be suicide to be seen there.”

“I’ll get the cheapest room in your hotel and text you the number. Please, Nicole, don’t say no.”

Even though she hung up, he took a risk and booked online using a fake name, arriving before the polls closed and everyone would be looking for him. 

“Darling, I promise you, it wasn’t me that wrote that garbage.” Chris almost dragged her into the room, hoping this time she would believe him.

“I know,” Nicole barely closed the door behind her before almost jumping into his arms. “But it hurt so much that it came from you. I want all those things, marriage and babies but I also want to do good in the world and I believe that I can do both, and I thought you either didn’t believe in me or you wanted to destroy me.”

“You’ll do it all, and I’ll be cheering you on from the sidelines,” he said even as their lips held their own conversation.

“No, you’ll be an amazing representative, and apparently I’ll go off and learn how to knit,” at least she could laugh even as her fingernails found the old scars to reopen.

“I’d vote for you,” he tried to say with all seriousness.

“Apparently, you did.”

“But you didn’t,” he pressed.

“If you win,” she said in between kisses, as he led her to the bed. “I hope that in time, you’d find room for me in your life, despite my party affiliations.”

“Is that what you want?” he stopped, needing to know.

“Chris, more than just about anything. I want you in my life even more than I want to win and if you ask my family, I always want to win.” Nicole didn’t wait for him to join her on the bed before starting to remove her blouse. 

“I kinda feel the same,” Chris couldn’t believe they were having this conversation as their bodies were already taking care of a different type of negotiation. Clothes quickly flung around the room. “After Thomas pulled that shit, I even thought about pulling out but there are too many other people invested in the campaign, it would be like total disrespect and slap in the face. I hope you understand.” Her kisses gave him confidence.

“So, what do we do.” One last question before their bodies took over.

“How about, to the winner, goes the spoils of office,” he suggested.

“And the loser?”

“I don’t know, how about they get to make the breakfast in bed on weekdays and keep the bed warm. I’ll even rub your feet every night.”

“I love you,” Nicole said so simply. “I wanted to say it before, but it never seemed like the right time.”

“I love you, but let me show you how much,” he said as conversation gave way to passion.

Never had it been so fierce, as if this really was their last chance at love. Not only stolen minutes that turned into hours, but a forbidden love that had survived all the tests.

“I still love you!” Nicole laughed finding the fridge empty. “But next time could you at least make sure the fridge has some bottled water!”


“I got another one,” Chris showed her his phone. Each of them had received almost a dozen texts from their teams.

“With so many candidates to cover, we won’t be missed out there,” Nicole assured him as their legs remained intertwined. 

“Another one! Apparently we are the news.”

Chris turned on the television to hear the commentators ponder about the elusive candidates.

“Could it be the nerves have finally caught up with our young candidates?” One of the panellists asked James Dawson who was representing his party.

“Knowing Chris Lowe, he’s probably already planning how to spend the next hundred days down to the minute.”

“He might have something there!” Chris laughed and turned the TV off. “We should go.”

“We should, but I don’t want to,” Nicole snuggled closer. “I don’t think our secret is going to stay a secret for too long and I’m not ready to share you with the world.”

An hour later, an exhausted Chris turned the TV back on just in time for the electoral commentators calling the result. He’d never been happier or more relieved in his entire life.

Smothered Nicole’s squeal with a kiss, he couldn’t stop smiling as he asked, “How on earth am I supposed to give a concession speech when I feel like I just won the biggest race of my life?”

“Just kiss me until you figure it out.”

So, he did.
