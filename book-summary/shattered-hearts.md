## Nina's world stopped at the same time as her daughter's heart.

Now, blocking every emotion is the only way she can survive.
Derek believes he must be strong, not just for himself, but for Nina, too. 
Now the small fractures in their marriage - once healed by love and friendship - threaten to tear them apart.

Desperate to bring Nina out of her grief, Derek turns to the last person he would have expected to seek out: the man who almost stole her away from him.

If you've ever struggled to hold a marriage together under the weight of grief. If you've ever cried over the loss of your child. If you want a reason to believe in love strong enough to give hope, you'll love Shattered Hearts

_Released on what would have been our daughter's 18th birthday, Shattered Hearts is for every mother who has cried. With love, Kenna._
