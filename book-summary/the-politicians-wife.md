**From the author**
The Politician's Wife was my first choose your own romance series that featured a complicated marriage.

After seeing one too many politicians, footballers, movie stars and other prominent men have their affairs splashed across the media, I wanted to write a book from the wife's perspective. Imagine that she had no idea until watching the news. Imagine the hurt and anger, especially when the man she loves has the balls to say that he loves another. What would she do and who could she trust?

Then I wanted to imagine a scenario when he realizes what he threw away and explore just how far he would go to be the one love in her life, again.

One thing you'll learn about my romances, is that I love writing confrontation scenes. There are a couple in The Politician's Wife and I hope you enjoy them as much as I did.

Cheating warning - As Susannah takes her husband's affair as a trigger to explore who she is and what she wants out of life, there are times when she turns to a lover's arms. That's the whole point of choose your own romance - taking a woman at a cross road in her life and deciding which man will be her happily ever after.

I'll be honest, her husband starts off as a lying, cheating b-word, but from the moment he realizes that he truly loves his wife, James is completely committed to winning her back.
