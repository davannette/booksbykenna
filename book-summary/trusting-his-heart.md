## A beautiful, heartfelt story of a widow, a widower and their courage to love again.

**Geoffrey Swains** would give up his career, money and lifestyle for **one more day with his late wife**.
He can replace her in his bed but never his heart. 
Ten years a widower, he never intended to meet someone special. 
The last thing he wanted to do was fall in love.

Except **Rebecca, “Call me Bec” Garran** wasn’t a student or just another woman.
Smart and sexy Bec refused to give up on him, even when he was ready to give up on life.


**Bec Garran** had lived this "dream" or nightmare before.
**Loving a man** only to lose him to his fears and then the disease.
This time things could be **different**. 
If only Geoffrey was willing to fight.

After all, what were the chances of them finding love again, with each other?
About the same chances as Geoffrey **Trusting his Heart**.

**Get your tissues and be prepared to believe in romance, love and happily ever after.**
