Sometimes there are minor characters in my books that make us want more. Early this year, I asked my readers to tell me what they wanted for Alex MacFarlane from [The Uni Student](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076NRVM5M/ "The Uni Student"). The response to [Have You Met ... Alex]({{ site.baseurl }}/book-summary/have-you-met-alex.html "Have You Met ... Alex") blew me away. 

Now there is [Have You Met ... Scout]({{ site.baseurl }}/book-summary/have-you-met-scout.html "Have You Met ... Scout") about one of my sexy military men; [Have You Met ... Chris]({{ site.baseurl }}/book-summary/have-you-met-chris.html "Have You Met ... Chris"); [Have You Met ... Tony]({{ site.baseurl }}/book-summary/have-you-met-tony.html "Have You Met ... Tony"); and [Have You Met ... Robert]({{ site.baseurl }}/book-summary/have-you-met-robert.html "Have You Met ... Robert").

This month, I’ve gone back to one of my favorite military romances, [Protect Her](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07J429XPV/ "Protect Her"). I asked who you wanted for Dr Alan Hunter - for nurse Charli to finally get her man, or whether Dr Danika White was his perfect love. I asked, you told me, here is **Have you met ... Dr Hunter**.

## Have you met ... Dr Hunter?

Dr Alan Hunter closed down his email and sighed, preferring to look outside to the palm trees and Townsville sunshine than read about his father and brothers’ expectations.

He’d only just agreed to attend the medical conference in Brisbane, and already his family were trying to schedule every spare minute instead of accepting that as one of the key-note speakers, his time might be better spent catching up with peers. 

They weren’t taking “no” for an answer but in all honesty, he was only going to agree to either breakfast one morning or a single family dinner the night before the conference. Anything more would exceed his tolerance to nod politely, yet again, to his brothers’ exploits and war-veteran stories, let alone ignore their infinite jokes about him sleeping soundly on base because they were the ones putting their lives on the line.

In their mind, he was “just a doctor.” Australia didn’t declare national holidays for doctors, nor did any of his successes get plastered over the national or international press or earn medals. Only his mother, God bless her soul, had ever encouraged him to break with family tradition and make his mark on the world in a different way.

For the last eight years, he’d been the head doctor at the Australian Army barracks in Townsville. Located thousands of kilometres away from other medical specialists, he was the go-to-guy in Far North Queensland for broken bodies and shattered minds. He consulted on cases all over the world and saw first-hand the hidden price colleagues of his father, brothers and uncles had paid for their service. The invitation to the medical conference had been extended because of his international reputation in physical and mental rehabilitation. No matter what his brother’s email suggested, it wasn’t just another Defence junket.

No, he didn’t need judgmental bullshit from his family — not when he got it 24/7 on base.

“Can I help you, Dr Hunter?” Charli swung by his office on her way through to the nurses’ station.

“Time for coffee later?” Hopefully, an emergency wouldn’t force one of them to cancel.

“Always time for you,” Charli almost made it around the side of his desk for a kiss before hearing her name over the hospital paging system. “Then again, duty calls.”

“Rain check?”

“Unless I get a better offer,” she teased and left, not knowing how fragile his ego had become. Tapping the table with the invitation, carefully printed out by his secretary and cleared through the Defence masters who saw the public relations benefit in having his name in lights, Alan tried to find reasons to look forward to the conference.

For a start, he bloody well deserved the professional accolades from the medical community — because he was never going to get it from his patients. Being an international expert in the treatment of and rehabilitation of war veterans didn’t mean shit to the man on the table, expecting Doctor Alan Hunter to perform miracles and get him back into the field.

Each man on base needed him but pretended and preferred they didn’t.

And every single bloody woman wanted to go home with an army hero and never saw the doctor who kept them whole. 

Charli. 

Damn it, she should know him well enough not to joke about trading him in for an army lover. He’d watched the female soldiers, doctors, nurses, and staff all turn to a quivering and horny mess the moment a fit guy in a camo singlet gave them any attention.

Immediately relegating him back to his role as serving the nation’s heroes. Never being seen as a hero in his own right.

“Here!” Charli waltzed into his office, blowing him kisses with his coffee before running off to deliver another three cups. Leaving him speechless, as usual.

Charli.

He’d have either resigned or demanded a posting closer to Sydney or Melbourne years ago if he hadn’t seen the blonde and curvy nurse dancing through the wards. 

Charli invigorated every room she entered with her vivacious energy and sunny personality — and her impact on the wounded was immediate. The moment she took on a patient, he fought harder with his exercises and gave one hundred percent effort to his recovery. All to impress his nurse.

“Ready for rounds, doctor?” Nikita asked? The glue that held the hospital together, his assistant made sure his time was managed, he went home to get real sleep once in a while, and that he ate healthy food at least occasionally.

“Where do you want me to start?”

“We got a new batch yesterday. Charli is working her magic with two of the youngsters and they should be just about ready for you to tell them what it will take to go back to breaking hearts.”

“Thanks.”

According to the emails he was trying to forget, one of his brothers was onto his third wife, his father now had one woman stashed in Canberra and lived with another in Brisbane while the baby of the family married his childhood sweetheart. Good for them, he tried to set aside his bitterness.

Only Alan had never needed to get spare keys cut; and never wanted to until he met Charli.

“Dr Hunter, we have some sad sacks here today!” she greeted him as he entered the surgical recovery ward. “I’d like you to meet Sapper Johnson and Sapper Rodwell. The gorgeous Sapper Johnson decided to give his face some character with shrapnel that almost took out his right eye at the same time as his arm decided to take a bullet. But he’s crying like a baby because this hospital doesn’t come with a make up artist so he can’t update his dating profile.” Alan knew that was code for the young man terrified about losing any use or strength in his arm. A quick check of the charts showed the shrapnel came close to the eye, but once the swelling went down, he’d be almost back to new.

“I already told you, have dinner with me and I won’t need a dating profile!” the young man tried to hide his fear through bravado. 

“How about we get that firing arm back to one hundred percent and then you’ll have your choice of nurses.” Or any other woman, Alan thought.

“Oh, doc, I’m a one-woman kinda guy and Nurse Charli is the only woman for me. I’ll do whatever you want, just get me out of this fucking bed and I’ll be sweeping her off her feet in no time.”

“You are so sweet,” Charli enthused for the bedridden soldier before hiding her raised eyebrows to Alan. “Sapper Rodwell has a slightly more complicated issue.”

“Doc, they say you got Mack out of the fucking bed, can you do the same for me?”

One punch, two punch. Alan couldn’t deal with his own emotions, not when Charli was standing right next to him.

“Let’s get you away from Casanova here, into a private room so you get the nurses to yourself, and we can put a plan in place,” he said, feeling Charli’s slight tremble over his shoulder while he gave his full attention to the soldier. “Every spinal injury is different, and each course of treatment is different. We need to wait until the swelling goes down, but there are a lot of exercises we can get you started on.”

“Whatever it takes, doc. I can’t be a fuckin’ cripple.”

“Nurse Charli, when you are free, can I have a minute?” He didn’t care if the soldiers noticed the soft touch on her back, but he did care about Charli’s reddening eyes. Sapper Rodwell’s injuries would be felt across the base, and by no one harder than Charli.

“Hi,” she closed his office door at the end of the day. “I’m sorry — I didn’t expect to get so emotional.”

“You okay?”

“I don’t love him anymore, really I don’t, it’s just …”

“I know, babe, I know.”

As he had a hundred times, he held Charli as she cried over yet another soldier who came to them broken, hoping that one day they’d leave their hospital bed feeling able to conquer anything and anyone.

Charli.

He’d never leave Townsville while she was still here.


Two days later and their rescheduled coffee ended up being dinner at the Italian restaurant in town. One of the few places that didn’t ban him if he had to cancel at the last minute, or if he needed to turn his dine-in order into take-away.

“Rodwell had a bit of a flat day today,” she started, pulling apart the cheesy garlic bread Alan only ordered for her.

“How did you handle it?”

“Combination of flattery and flirting. We’ve set a heap of mini milestones and each time he hits one, I’ll bring him a real coffee.”

“You are incorrigible.”

“Between the two of us, we get results,” she offered her glass to toast. “To us and everything we have and will achieve?”

Alan sat back, listened while she chatted away about each of the current patients and her day, while thinking about how they’d gotten here. 

Charli arrived, full of energy in about his fourth or fifth year. Turning the base upside down and the hospital clinic was suddenly full of soldiers needing to be checked out by “the hot new nurse.”

Alan had watched her bat away one after the other like summer flies, thinking that if only he bided his time, she’d look at him with the same desire and respect that she gave the soldiers. 

Until the womanizing, man-whore Damon Mackenzie noticed she existed. 

Alan could only watch helplessly as the hurricane affair took hold. Knowing that Mack would screw up, screw around and move on, didn’t help; not when almost everyone who knew Mack could see that the collateral damage would be Charli.

Was it only a year ago or two? Alan smiled at whatever she was saying, thinking back to the night her life changed — and his.

Friday night drinks after work and Alan was powerless to stop Charli from walking in to see Mack with his tongue down some other woman’s throat. Not thinking twice before leaving his friends, it was Alan who bundled her into his car and took her to an all-night café, listening to her unburden all of the reasons why she couldn’t love Mack, shouldn’t love Mack, but did.

Grateful to have moved past the “colleagues” tag to what he thought was an upgraded, “friends,” Alan tried not to notice the number of times Charle forgave Mack, only to be disappointed and break up again. Alan thought that his chance was never going to happen and had finally accepted their friendship when Mack did the unthinkable — and fell in love.

To Alan’s surprise, Charli hadn’t been devastated by Mack’s new love and gradually Alan realized the difference between her harmless flirting for injured soldiers, and her genuine flirting — that she reserved for him.

“When are you going to ask me out?”

“We go out all the time,” he had hedged, not wanting to ruin their friendship over a misunderstanding.

“We go out as friends, is that all you see me as?”

“How do you want me to see you?” Alan had asked softly, leaning in until she did the same. 

Noses almost touching, she breathed, “Well we work together, so that could be complicated.”

“You could say that about everybody on base.”

“Touché, so how do you see me? Am I just a nurse to you?”

“What if I told you that you are one of my closest friends on base.” A truth but only part of the whole truth.

“I’d say, I feel like you just friend-zoned me.”

“Is that a problem.”

“Only if you don’t like kissing friends.”

That first night, they’d moved from being colleagues, to friends to lovers before midnight. After wanting her for so long, Alan was content to cover her body in kisses, inhale her essence and take his time to love her as if he could lose her. Making love to her as if it could be their only time together, as if the next day she’d forget him for another wounded army hero.

Watching her eyes open so slightly as he took her, the small purr as he brought her to the brink and held her their until she cried out his name. Only then did he trust that she was truly in bed with him and he wasn’t competing with ghosts of her past.

“Hey!” Charli flicked water at him, bringing him back to the restaurant. “Where did you go.”

“I was thinking about our first time,” he admitted, pulling her hand to his lips and kissing the garlic butter from her fingers. “I never thought you saw me as a man, I really thought I was just a rebound.”

“Because of Mack?” She pulled away, more hurt than angry. “Is this because of Rodwell lying back at base thinking that his life is over?”

“It has to bring back memories for you, too,” Alan had a perverse need to give Charli permission to admit he’d never be enough.

"Damn you,” she snapped, standing up. “I thought we’d gotten past all that. Mack and I were over long before he got together with Xanthe — and we were well and truly over before you and I got together, but no matter what I say or how often I say it, you only see what you want to see.”

“I was there that night.” Sometimes he wished he could just leave the past alone, instead of whipping himself with it.

“No, you weren’t there when we had a fight, when he stormed off. You were only there to see him hook up with some random and see me as a pathetic loser who bawled her eyes out in your car.”

“I was there for you.” Alan wanted to be her hero, saving her from a whoring scum-bag.

“You were there for yourself, and I feel like every day since, you’ve wanted me to get down on my knees and thank you. After all, I’m only a lowly nurse and you are the amazing Dr Alan Hunter — what could you possibly see in me other than pity.”

“Charli, wait,” he cried, but she’d already rushed out of the restaurant. By the time he’d paid the bill, there was no sign of her up or down the street.

_Alan: I’m sorry._

He forced himself to wait three whole minutes before texting again.

_Alan: I’m really sorry. Come to Brisbane with me._

They’d never travelled together, not as a couple. This whole jealousy thing had to stop. Right now, today, Charli had chosen him. Perhaps tomorrow or next week, she’d go back to falling in love with soldiers, but when she did, he’d have a lifetime to miss her. Damn it, he needed to get over himself and enjoy every minute they had together.

Love her as if he was going to lose her. Make sure when she left him, he wouldn’t be sitting back thinking about all the things he should have done.

_Alan: I want you to come to Brisbane and meet my family._



Charli waited until she was in the taxi before checking her beeping phone. If he wanted to break up with her, why didn’t he have the guts to give it to her straight. “Charli, it’s been fun but you’ll only ever be a nurse and I want more than that.” Simple, and final. Instead of all this bullshit about her ex. 

She checked the first message, he was sorry, so what. 

“Excuse me, I forgot something — can you please turn around?” Charli asked the driver, trying to take in the second two messages. At no time had she thought their relationship had gotten to the point of meeting family.

_Charli: We can’t keep doing this._

Only after she pressed send, did she realize how he might take it. Halfway through trying to type an explanation, that they needed to stop hurting each other with nonsense fights, his response arrived.

_Alan: Agreed. Forget I asked. Forget everything._

Twice she tried to call him but hung up when going through to his voice mail. Crying, she changed her directions again for the taxi driver, barely noticing the drive back to her bed sit. Fresh sheets on the bed, for Alan. His milk in the refrigerator and she’d even made up the bircher muesli he loved, with double the cranberries pre-soaked in apple juice. He had never realized that was the difference between her mixture and shop bought.

What had been the point?

He’d always be the world-renowned Dr Hunter and she’d only ever be some woman he slept with while posted to Townsville. She’d heard the rumors about the Brisbane conference, all the other doctors were taking bets on who’d be making Alan the offers and how much would it cost to woo him away from the base.

He wouldn’t stay for her, and there was no way he’d ask her to go with him.

Charli found one of his old shirts stuffed in the back of her closet. She only got it out on nights like this, needing to feel him close.

_Charli: I guess we only ever hurt the ones we love, and I do_

Her finger trembled over the button. She’d never had the courage to say the words in person, and it seemed pathetic to say them now as a way to hold onto something she never had.

Carefully, she backspaced until accidently sending only half the message. Despite her tears, she smiled, it seemed almost poetic and appropriate for their relationship. Doing everything by halves.



_Charli: I guess we only ever hurt_

What the hell did she mean by that?

Alan didn’t have the energy to find out. Leaving his acceptance to the conference to the last minute meant he had the perfect excuse to take a couple of days of leave to prepare his talking notes and speech. Avoid the hospital and try to avoid any thoughts of Charli.

What had he been thinking, inviting her to meet his family? They’d fall in love with her and insist she could do better than him. One brother would flirt and remind her that soldiers knew exactly what to do with their bodies, while the other would sit back in quiet infatuation before going home to his own family. The whole week was utterly predictable, and it was probably for the best that she broke up with him when she did.

To hell with her and his family. He didn’t need the reminders of his failings as a son, brother or boyfriend. Alan locked himself away to edit a new research paper he could introduce at the conference. Early thinkings, but it would be good to put the ideas out and see if there were any potential collaborators. Changing his flights to arrive the morning of the conference, he sent apologies to his father. Perhaps another time.

The moment Alan exited the aircraft in Brisbane, he felt the full force of the muggy, all-encompassing heat. Townsville might have more of its fair share of cyclones, but he’d never been tempted to swap it for the city or more stable climate. 

“Dr Hunter?” A suited chauffeur addressed him. Clearly, he was the only age-appropriate and smart casually dressed person who’d gotten off the flight. 

“G’day,” he offered in greeting, extending his hand. 

“Have you got any luggage you’d like me to get for you, Sir?”

“Nah, I’ve only got my carry-on.

“You are Dr Alan Hunter, right?” Clearly the driver was expecting someone pretentious or laden with luggage.

“Absolutely, but I’ve learned to pack light.”

“Let me take your bags sir.” 

Alan sat back and tried to relax as the driver gave a running commentary on the local football teams. He’d promised Charli to take her to the game next time her beloved Brisbane Broncos played in Townsville. He was more a soccer fan than rugby league, but had quickly learned he could enjoy a sport vicariously through her passion.

Damn it. He needed to make some decisions, professionally and personally. Was he really destined to spend his entire life playing second fiddle to a bunch of soldiers for an employer who only saw him as a tool to get the most out of its primary human resources, or was there something more out there? The answer to the question was why he’d put off replying to the conference organizers until the last minute.

Almost nine months ago, the first invitation came through, appealing to his ego by describing him as the “international expert on rehabilitation of war heroes.” Alan had never seen himself like that, really he was only part of a team who worked together to do their job. One patient at a time, finding the best techniques or trialing, refining and applying new combinations of techniques to the case at hand. Until he decided to brush off his ideas for a research paper, he hadn’t known how to fill two hours without repeating himself. 

“There you go, mate. Enjoy Brisbane.” The chauffeur dropped him at the hotel foyer, introducing him to the concierge as if he was a bloody rockstar.

“Certainly, Dr Hunter. Welcome to Brisbane.” He hadn’t even finished checking in before half a dozen people fought for his attention.

“Dr Hunter, I’d like to get your views on …”

“So glad you could make it …”

“Dr Hunter …”

“Dr Hunter …”

Help, this was overwhelming. Half the people on base didn’t even know his name and even his former patients called him Dr Alan in error. Now he was inundated with breakfast and luncheon invitations and research collaboration ideas.

A man in demand.

Alan couldn’t pretend the attention was normal and waited as his would-be-suitors discussed with whom his time would be better spent.

“I can only assume that you are Dr Alan Hunter from all the fans you have here?” The sultry female voice from behind got his full attention.

Turning, he expected to see the stunning redhead in the conference organization’s uniform. Instead, her gorgeous auburn curls offset the deep green dress that folded softly over her hips. Looking back up, he dared not inspect her name tag pinned over her breast, lest his eyes not flow back up to her face.

Who the hell was this vision who’d come to save him?

“It would appear that I am Alan Hunter, but I’m still finding my way around the conference and am just checking in.”

The peers who were so eager to get his attention, didn’t even notice when he stepped closer to the sexy stranger.

“Well, I believe we are going to be co-chairing a panel discussion on maintaining professional networks and building our careers whilst servicing patients in remote and rural communities.”

“We are?” He was quite astonished. “I thought I was giving the opening address on the second day.”

Her laugh was like silk, “Apparently a couple of speakers pulled out, so some of us are pulling double duty. You’ve probably got an email waiting for you when you check in. Mine came through about an hour ago and I decided to come down and leave you a message so we could catch up. Lucky me, you were here waiting.”

“Lucky me, you mean,” he said without thinking. “I didn’t catch your name.”

“Danika, Danika White.”

“Then it is an absolute pleasure to meet you, Dr White.”

“Please call me Danika.” He didn’t know whether to kiss or shake her hand, shaking would be safer, for both of them. 

“Dr Hunter?” the concierge needed his attention again. “If you’d like to follow your guest through to the bar area, I can have your bags waiting for you in your room?”

He turned to Danika, “I guess that’s my cue to offer you a drink?”

“I’d be honored.”

He looked over to the group of men who were now discussing whose research project would have the greatest commercial value. “Actually, you’d be doing me the favor, saving me from them.”

“And here I was thinking you were the one doing the saving!” She lightly took his arm, allowing him to lead her safely through the foyer and waited to be seated in the dimmed room.

Standing in silence, Alan couldn’t help comparing Dr Danika White to Charli Sims. Auburn hair to blonde; tall and graceful to Charli’s petite effervescence. Not that it should make a difference but spending an hour or two talking to another doctor would be refreshing. Someone who understood the pressure of making life altering decisions and being the one accountable for those decisions. 

“Who are you missing the most?” Danika asked as they waited for a table to be cleared.

“What?” His immediate thoughts went to Charli.

“We’ve all left patients behind and are hoping that our locum won’t screw up. Who are you missing the most?”

“Sapper Rodwell. Young kid involved in a training accident. His mate caught a bullet to the arm and shrapnel to the face.”

“Which tells me more about young mister Rodwell — he either means something to you or the case reminds you of another patient.”

She nailed it in one. The hardest patient he ever had to deal with was when Charli’s ex, Mack, had been stretchered back to base, barely surviving being blown up overseas, his injuries hit the base hospital hard. Dr Hunter worked closely with Mack’s girlfriend, the hospital occupational therapist, to stabilize and develop a rehab plan, but it was Charli’s reaction that Alan the man feared the most. Was Charli was distraught because it was someone she knew or because it was a lover she wanted back in her life. Every single fucking decision that Dr Hunter had to make about Mack’s treatment tore him apart with uncharacteristic second guessing. Was he making the decision because he wanted Mack to stay paralyzed, stay in the bloody wheelchair or was he able to look at Mack as just another patient, deserving of his care.

It wasn’t as if he could even talk to Charli about her feelings and his fear, after all what separated the doctor from the man? Emotions that had been buried until Charli introduced him to Sapper Rodwell.

“Spinal injury. I’ve seen worse, but it never gets easier.”

“Managing their expectations or giving them incentive to fight?”

“I’ve got a great team. One of my nurses has him on an incentive program. Each minor milestone, she’ll buy him a coffee and have one with him.” He smiled, Charli had a way with the men and it never failed to achieve results.

“She sounds amazing,” Danika said. “I don’t think we could embed it in a standard operating procedure, unless you’ve figured out how to clone her.”

“Oh, no,” Alan tried not to blush. “Charli is definitely an original, but she gets results.”

Luckily, the waitress was ready to escort them to their table. “Ready for that drink?” Danika asked.

“Absolutely, what’s your pleasure — red, white or bubbles.”

“Would it seem odd if I asked for a shandy?”

After the momentary trip down memory lane about Charli and Mack, Dr Hunter welcomed the reason to laugh. “Are you serious, you want a shandy? Beer and lemonade – I offer you the world and you ask for beer and lemonade?”

“It kind of makes sense if you think about it,” Danika said with the confidence of a woman who didn’t care about being different. “When I’m working. I want something that takes a little bit of the edge off, but even if I’m not on call, you never know when you get that phone call that says I’m sorry, doctor, but …”

Alan laughed, “Oh yes — I’m sorry doctor, but there’s a helicopter coming in with just a couple problems for you to look at.”

“Except, the problems are never little once you peel off the clothes,” Danika continued his sentence. “The gunshot goes in cleanly but you know that his back …”

“You’ve had a few of those?”

“I’m sure we’ve both got our war stories to tell, doctor,” Danika’s eyes clouded over.

“How about I tell you mine if you tell me yours.” Alan just wanted to make conversation, “What’s the toughest patient you’ve ever had to deal with?”

Only, Danika’s eyes clouded over, and he realized it had been one question too far. “You don’t have to talk about it, yet, if you don’t want to,” Alan didn’t even realize he’d said the word “yet.”

“Are you ready to order?” the waitress saved him from embarrassed silence.

“One shandy,” he replied, looking towards Danika. “Make that two. I’m willing to live dangerously.”

He watched the waitress give over their order and waited for the barman’s judgmental glance over towards him — labelling him as a man willing to drink anything in order to impress a woman.

“You don’t have to drink that if you don’t want to,” Danika protested when their drinks arrived.

Instead, he offered a toast, “To the ones we couldn’t save.”

She lightly touched his glass with her own. “I’ll drink to that.”



Charli hadn’t expected Alan to do a complete disappearing act after their dinner. Usually, one of them would flip out over something innocuous but a nod or delivery of coffee back at the hospital would get them back in sync. Instead, he’d handed over all his cases to a locum from Richmond Airforce base who didn’t appreciate Charli’s approach with the patients. Actually, he didn’t respect any of the nurses or the resident doctors. 

“Not getting your usual special treatment?” Jodi asked in the break room.

“Alan doesn’t give me special treatment,” she protested to her friend who knew them all too well.

“Alan, is it? Well Doctor Hunter doesn’t bring me coffee when I’ve been on my feet for ten hours straight.”

“He’s in Brisbane at that conference.” She needed someone to talk to. “We had a fight before he left, and I think we’re over.”

“Honey, the way he looks at you, it’s only over if you’ve changed your mind about him.”

“I haven’t, but he’s down in the city. Surrounded by other doctors and I keep hearing about him getting job offers to leave.”

“So, leave with him.”

“What if he doesn’t ask?” Charli went back to the wards before Jodi could give her a reassurance that would only be a lie. Alan deserved so much more than this small base could offer — and someone better than her.

“Nurse Charli!” Rodwell called to her as she tried to walk past his room.

“Hey, yourself,” she forced a happy voice. “Where are we up to today?”

“I sat up on my own for almost ten minutes!”

“Well, when you get to ten minutes, I’ll get you that coffee.”

“Could you put a dash of bourbon in that?” he pleaded. Any other nurse would brush him off, but Charli knew better.

“As soon as you can get yourself into a wheelchair, how about I take you down to the rec hall for a drink. Maybe even a movie?” It was a stretch goal, and something that could take weeks or months, depending on the man, his injuries and his willpower.

“You’ll have a drink with me?”

“Rodwell, I don’t date soldiers, but for you, I’ll at least promise you a drink.”

“What’s with you and the doctor?” he asked.

“What do you mean?”

“When you lie back here, all you can do is watch and listen. You glow when he walks into a room and he looks at you as if you created, I don’t know, the internet.”

She thought before answering. “I promise you that drink and even a movie.”

“I asked you about the doctor.”

“It’s complicated,” she hedged.

“The good ones always are.”

“I think I’ve heard that somewhere before. Look, we were dating but I think he broke up with me.”

“You think?”

“Like I said, it’s complicated.”

“Lady, look at me!” he spread his arms out to make her look at him and his room. “Fucking two weeks ago, I could walk into any room and fuck any woman I wanted.”

She’d known and loved another man like that.

“Now I need someone to change my pee bag and as much as I’ve always wanted to be bathed by two women at once, my fantasies never included a hospital bed.”

“Your point is?” she asked, knowing the answer but needing to hear it.

“Life is short. Don’t let a guy who looks at you like the doc slip through your fingers just because you’re too lazy to uncomplicate things.”

Spontaneously, she hugged Rodwell. “We are going to get you to that rec hall,” she promised.

“Yes, we will!”



Dr Hunter listened as Danika talked about her childhood and growing up, the only girl with four brothers.

"I get it,” he said. “Both of my brothers joined the Army, I’m the black sheep not by gender, but by profession.”

"What do you mean, ‘black sheep’?”

“Let’s just say Christmas lunch about my father, grandfather and brothers all outdoing each other over who took the biggest risks and who survived the worst anything. They just keep one upping themselves.”

“Whereas my brothers went into medical specialties and I’m just a doctor.”

“You’re not just a doctor to me,” Dr Hunter didn’t even realize what he’d said until after the words came out, taking her hand in his. “You are beautiful, you are intelligent, and I can tell that you’ve saved a hell of lives, more than you or others ever expected.

“I could say the same about you doctor, isn’t that why we’re both here today up at this conference to tell people how we save bodies and minds that others thought would be irrecoverable.”

“Do you want another drink?”

One night of drinking and talking wasn’t enough. Not that he could compare Danika to Charli. The two women was so completely different and Danika was everything professionally that he could want in a partner.

But Charli, would always be his Charli. Whether she loved him back, or not.

The next morning he met Danika downstairs for breakfast, “Join me for Eggs Benedict?” she asked.

He shuddered at the thought. “I usually get bircher muesli,” he laughed as she screwed up her face. “What?” he protested. “I like having the same thing for breakfast no matter where I am.”

“Something I didn’t know last night, you are certainly full of surprises.”

“It’s not like you gave me a choice,” he said. “If I remember, our conversation was all about saving lives and being the black sheep within our families.”

“Tell me more.”

“Well I like muesli for breakfast and salad for lunch.” It had never sounded so boring until said aloud. Was that how Charli saw him — old and boring?

“I prefer eggs for breakfast and something hot for lunch,” Danika smiled as their meals quickly arrived. “After all, if I get a chance to have lunch, I want something hot and filling in case it’s the last time I get to eat for the day.”

“Well, I’m the opposite,” Alan watched as Danika’s eggs opened up to soft yolks, merging with the sauce. They looked good, but he’d still stick with his muesli. “I’d rather something I can snack on at my desk that doesn’t go cold. But my dinner must be hot, there’s absolutely nothing more I love after a long day than a spicy chilli.” This wasn’t the time to tell Danika about Charli’s forty-eight-hour beef chilli. She made it whenever they were about to go on night shift, packaging it into meal sized containers for the hospital fridge. He smiled at the thought of how many nights he’d kept warm by her chilli while wishing to be home, in bed with her body. Something, no one else could understand.

Luckily, any thoughts of talking about Charli, again, were put aside when the conference organizer hurried up to them, needing a fresh copy of their slides before the question and answer session.


Alan could only watch in awe as Danika handled herself well in front of what at times was a hostile crowd full of self-important people who didn’t understand or didn’t want to understand patient centric care. 

“It’s okay, for Dr Hunter here, he gets paid by the public and can take whatever time he wants.” An obnoxious comment from the floor.

To his surprise, Danika put the speaker and the room on notice that early and intensive intervention was often more cost-effective in dealing with ongoing health issues, especially amongst veterans.

_Charli would have loved to be here,_ he thought. She might not have the professional qualifications or standing of the other attendees, but there hadn’t been a conversation here that they hadn’t had over dinner or in bed. Her passion for her patients made him a better doctor — something in her eyes trusting him to find a solution, challenged him to try harder and never give up.

Danika may be the doctor, tall and graceful; but she’d never be Charli.

No one could ever be Charli.

After the session concluded, he motioned to his phone, stopping Danika or any others from coming over to talk to him. Finding a quiet corner, Alan dialed his favorite number.

“Hi, stranger! I didn’t expect to hear from you.” Alan tried to believe the excitement in her voice was for him.

“I don’t have long to talk, but what do you think about getting a spontaneous gift from me?”

“Flowers, chocolates or lingerie?” she flirted.

"How about a plane ticket to Brisbane for a dirty weekend away? If you say ‘yes’ then I’ll see about the lingerie waiting for you.”

“Does that mean we are still together?”

“Unless you’ve already replaced me with one of your soldier heroes,” he snapped, immediately regretting his words. 

“I told you months ago how I feel about you.” The happiness in her voice had died and more quickly than usual, they’d come back to the impasse neither of them could avoid.

“It’s just a simple question. Come to Brisbane unless you’ve already got a better offer from one of your soldier heroes.”

“How many times do I have to tell you, you are the only hero I want in my life.”

“Until you trade me in.”

“You wanted me to meet your family.”

“You ended things.”

“I didn’t mean it.”

Looking towards where Danika was waiting for him and colleagues were eager to hear his pearls of wisdom, Alan needed to get his head back into doctor mode. “Forget it. Forget the invitation and everything I just said. All I’ve ever been to you was a shoulder to cry on when some asshole was taking time out with another woman.”

“Alan, please.” Despite the pleading in her voice, Alan couldn’t control his jealousy or self-doubt.

“Forget about coming to Brisbane. I was a fool thinking we could have that conversation you keep insisting we need.”

Any other time he’d ended a relationship, there had been a sense of relief and at least a little optimism at beginning the next chapter of his life.

The desolate blackness of life without Charli was terrifying. He’d loved her so intensely and for so long that the idea they could be ended in a single phone call didn’t make sense. Surely, there needed to be a national day or month of mourning.

“You okay?” Danika asked, ushering him towards the plenary room.

“No, but I will be.”

“Charli?”

“She’s not coming. Ever.”

“I’m so sorry.”

All the degrees in the world couldn’t give him the words to reply.



At the same time her phone went dead, the cashier asked for her order.

“Skim flat white with two, please.” It was the only decision she felt qualified to make. Alan had ended things. It wasn’t her imagination. He’d gone to Brisbane, probably found a doctor fangirl or six and had moved on. 

“Take away or have here?” the cashier repeated until Charli shook her head. 

“Sorry, what?”

“Do you want your coffee to go or to have here, sweetheart?” the older woman was full of misplaced sympathy.

She’d just finished night shift and it was either eating here or hoping something edible was still in her cupboard at home.

“Actually, I might have it here and can I have a bowl of your muesli as well?”

“Long night?” Most of the cafeteria staff knew the nurses by sight and Charli could often rely on an extra muffin or slice as part of her meal.

“Yes, but it’s going to be a longer day.”

She didn’t blame Alan for his stupid feelings of jealousy and self-doubt, after all the way they got together was after she had made such a fool of herself with Mack. But even now with Mack and Xanthe living in Brisbane, Alan still couldn’t see past what for her had been a mad and passionate affair but had never truly been love. Not for either of them. What she had with Alan could be so amazing if only he accepted that she’d only ever be a nurse and that all she wanted was to be the only woman in his life. For the rest of his life.

“Here you go, love.”

“Thank you,” Charli said, automatically and without thinking.

“Where’s that gorgeous doctor of yours?”

“Who? Alan?”

“That’s the one. You make a cute couple.”

“We broke up,” the words choked on their way out. 

“Oh, love,” the older cashier said. “The only thing that is permanent is death. You’ll find your way back to each other.”

“From your lips,” Charli started the old saying before pulling out her phone. If there was a single seat on a flight going to Brisbane today, she’d take it as a sign.

_Charli: Hi Jodes. Have stacks of leave and am taking a week off. Tell the roster supervisor they can accept my leave request or sack me. Going to Brisbane. Wish me luck._

_Jodi: Give Alan a kiss from me and tell him we need him here._

If she went home, she’d have half an hour to pack for the conversation that she and Alan had put off for far too long. Either he had to accept her as she was, or she needed to accept that he had moved on and whatever she felt didn’t matter. 

Opening her closet and she was surrounded by choice but with nothing to wear. A wardrobe full of sexy clothes, outfits that never failed to turn him on, yet she couldn’t bring herself to throw any of them in her bag. This wasn’t about proving their chemistry — she smiled at how many times that fact had been proven. Time and time again, his hands had made her body his own.

No. This was about their future, and far too important. One last chance for Alan to understand that she might be a nurse, but as long as she could be by his side, that together they could have whatever life he wanted, they wanted.

The afternoon flight was cancelled and she almost took it as a sign to abort the whole idea, until the airline offered her a free upgrade for the first flight out the next day, with complimentary champagne. According to the updated conference itinerary, the new flight would get her to the conference centre just before his keynote address.

Paying for parking at Townsville, Charli almost changed her mind again before boarding. What if he didn’t want her to turn up unannounced? What if he’d already found someone as amazing as he was and he took one look and said “Charli who?”

The inflight champagne had calmed her nerves, but was quickly forgotten as soon as the taxi driver dropped her outside the conference centre. Dozens of dignified people, wearing expensive suits and filled with self-importance streamed past her. If their clothes didn’t intimidate her, overhead snippets of conversation certainly did. Talk of holiday homes, expensive cars and overseas holidays — either they were all trying to outdo each other, or this was life of the incredibly successful doctors.

Who the hell was she, expecting to waltz in and get the attention of the man who’s name was on all the advertising banners and being announced over the loud speaker. Apparently, Alan’s keynote address was starting soon and anticipation was building. Two older, distinguished gentlemen were talking next to her. Her ears pricked up at the sound of Alan’s name.

“Have you come across Hunter before?”

“Only by reputation, I tried to poach him to come down south and set up a rehab clinic. I had the government funding lined up and everything.”

“What happened.”

“He wouldn’t leave his soldiers.”

“Surely you offered him enough money?”

“Mate, it wasn’t even about the money. I offered him to name his own price, knowing that the government would match it.”

“What sort of doctor turns down an offer like that?” 

_What doctor indeed,_ Charli thought. Alan hadn’t said a thing to her, not that considering his job offers were any of her concern. It wasn’t as if she meant anything.

This was a mistake, she thought as the doctors continued. 

“Well, I hope that we can get enough intel from him today to set up the clinic without him. There’s more than enough money for all of is if we can package up his ideas and sell them.”

“Good luck.”

In her black trousers, white shirt and black leather jacket, Charli was able to walk through the foyer and to the conference area without arousing any suspicion. Joining a large group, she was even able to walk into the lecture room without a pass.

_I guess gate crashers aren’t really a thing at these sort of events,_ she thought, finding a spare seat at the back of the room. For the next half hour, Charli listened to the man she loved hold the power of the room in the palm of his hand. Yes, she knew how amazing he was and had seen him work with broken men and women, believing in them until they could believe in their own recovery. But she’d never seen him like this before, in control, feted and respected by people that had qualifications longer than their name.

As his presentation came to an end, Charli started looking around, trying to decide how to reveal her presence. 

“Thank you all for your time,” Alan said as the MC came onto the stage. “I would like to invite on stage a colleague you heard speak yesterday when we shared the podium. Now, the question and answer session wasn’t as well attended as we would have liked,” Alan continued to the laughs of the crowd.

The MC interjected, “I heard there was standing room only.”

“What I meant to say,” Alan joked like a pro. “Was because I’ve finished my address early, and since this is about giving my learned colleagues what they need to go away and increase their billable hours; I would like to invite Dr Danika White to share the stage so we can continue our Q&A session.”

Charli’s heart sank and all thoughts of finding Alan after the presentation died as she recognized the chemistry between Alan and the auburn-haired woman. The banter between them went back and forth, teasing each other while finishing each other’s sentences. Charli didn’t belong here; Alan didn’t belong with her. He deserved so much better than she could ever give him.


Charli hurried back to the concierge desk to get her bags and organize the quickest way to get out of Brisbane and back to Townsville. Go back to the airport and get on the first plane or train or bus whatever it took to get her back home. Alan could never know that she was here, but with a dozen businessmen waiting to check in, Charli couldn’t even get the concierge’s attention.

“Charli?” a female voice asked from behind.

She cautiously turned to see the gorgeous doctor. How on earth did she recognize her, especially from behind? “That was an interesting presentation, congratulations.” 

“I thought it was you, I think Alan spent hours showing me photos of the two of you over dinner last night. You have an amazing gift with your patients.” 

Charli didn’t know he kept photos of her, his constant taking of photos had become a private joke — especially when he didn’t use social media. Still, he could now replace them with the stunning vision in front of her.

“Are you checking in or checking out. He’d loved to see you, if you give me a minute, I’ll go and extract him from his fans.”

“I saw the two of you.” Her voice and body shook with jealousy. Not anger or rage, just a sad ending to a relationship that was over before they really had a chance to see how far they could go. It wasn’t helped by comparing her cheap but practical clothes with the designer suit and expensive heels worn by the doctor.

“What do you think you saw, Charli?” Danika asked, her eyes soft and gentle. She’d be perfect for Alan.

“I saw the way he looked at you.”

“I’ve seen the way he looks at your photos and talks about you.”

“I only came here because …” Charli started, needing to get out of here before she lost whatever was left of her self-respect and composure.

“Because he sent you the tickets right? Alan told me he wanted a fresh start for the two of you.”

“He withdrew the invitation, but like the fool that I am, I came anyway.” She didn’t care about her bags, she just needed to get away.

“And just like that, you see him on the stage with me and now you’re going? Please don’t.”

“I think it’s best — I’m only ever going to be a nurse and he deserves someone like you.”

The concierge finally handed over her bags and as soon as Danika headed back towards the lecture room, Charli escaped into the waiting taxi.



Alan had given up looking for Danika and was heading upstairs to listen to a colleague’s presentation on wholistic pain relief when he recognized her footsteps from behind.

“She’s here!” Danika panted.

“Who? Dr Stratton? I’m catching up with her for coffee later.” 

“No, you idiot, Charli. Your Charli is here.”

“I don’t understand,” Alan said, looking around as if Charli was miraculously going to appear beside him. “We talked, we argued, and I was going to send her a ticket, but I didn’t.”

“Well, I have news for you, she was getting her bags back from the concierge when I saw her.”

“Are you sure? She can’t be the only blonde woman in the world.”

Charli? No, it couldn’t be her. Why would she leave without talking to him?

“You are absolutely clueless.” People started staring as Danika’s shrill voice cut through the polite conversations. “Seriously? I’m telling you that Charli was here, but leaving and you want to stand here arguing whether or not it is the real Charli?” Danika waited for his reaction before stressing, “Alan, it’s her. I spoke to her.”

Alan looked back down the spiral staircase towards the foyer and exit. 

“Charli was here?”

“That’s what I’ve been trying to tell you, you fool. She was here and now she’s not. Apparently, she watched us together up on stage and thinks you can do better than her.”

He called bullshit. Charli had no reason to be insecure or jealous, not about him. “It’s not like that at all. I didn’t want to go into it last night with you, but on base she is always surrounded by Army guys. She dated one for ages before he broke her heart and I was her rebound.” The truth sounded pathetic when he said it aloud. “That’s all I’ve ever been to her—a consolation prize until she finds her next Army hero.”

Danika looked at him with disgust and disappointment, “Are you even listening to yourself? She thinks you want a doctor not a nurse. You think she wants an army guy and not a doctor. Why can’t you both just open your eyes and realize what’s in front of you.”

“But …” he tried to explain.

“No, no ‘buts’ — not everyone gets a chance at love and to see the two of you kept apart by ego, pride and miscommunication is why I only hook up with randoms via Tinder.”

“Then what should I do? You said she’s leaving. I blew it.”

Danika pulled him to the side. “Then think about what you want, because if it is Charli, you’ve got one chance to go get her and make her see sense. And if there is even a small chance that you think she’s right and you will only ever see her as a nurse, then let her go. Let her find happiness however she wants and move on with your life.”

He could wait until they both got back home to Townsville, or sort things out now. “Let me check out if they’ve put me on again,” Alan found the conference organizer’s green room and Danika waited while he checked the latest schedule.

“Anything more important that Charli?”

“I’m supposed to stay for another day, but there’s nothing that I can’t make up for with a coffee or lunch sometime soon.”

The first call to Charli went straight through to voicemail.

“Charli, babe, don’t get on that plane and go back to Townsville. That weekend I promised you that talk we need to have. Let’s do it. Please don’t get on that plane.”

Just in case she didn’t get the message, he left it for her another three times before Danika held his arm stopping him from dialing again.

“I think she would have got the message by now. You don’t want her to go back to Townsville.”

“How can we sort things out if she’s given up on us?”



Charli saw the messages pile up in her voicemail. The first one had been easy to ignore; the second message had almost tempted her to press “play.” After the fourth message, she excused herself from the taxi driver’s conversation and started with Alan’s first message.

She wanted to believe him, listening to the sincerity in his voice as each recording gave the same message delivered in different words. If she tried hard enough, she could hear the pleading and even love in his voice. 

“Could you pull over for a couple of minutes, please?” The exit ramp to the airport was up ahead and she had to make up her mind. 

“It’s your money,” the cabbie shrugged and left the meter running while she got out and stretched. 

Loving Alan was the easy part, but the idea of having an honest conversation with him, allowing him to see how vulnerable she was because of her feelings for him — terrifying. What if she put her heart out only for his idea of a conversation was to hope they could still be friends and continue working together. 

Her phone vibrated in her hand. Alan, calling again. They couldn’t keep going on like this, making assumptions and hurting each other. Today had to be the day for a decision, whether she could live with it, or not.



Alan had kept looking at his phone, wishing that Charli would respond. Paralyzed by indecision whether to keep calling or try and race her to the airport.

“You’re a woman, what should I do?” he asked Danika.

“Like I said before, what do you really want out of this relationship? I mean, what is it that you and Charli even having common?”

“Other being good friends? You meet her and it’s easy to stop at her looks and personality, but she has so much depth and layers — and she’s the only woman I’ve ever wanted to spend the rest of my life getting to know.”

To hell with what Danika thought, and without allowing himself a chance to overthink or change his mind, Alan rang Charli’s number again.

“I hope you know what you’re doing, good luck.”

While waiting for Charli to either pick up or voicemail again, Alan replied, “I’m getting on the next plane back to Townsville she can either talk to me here or she can talk to me there, but somehow, she’s going to bloody well talk to me.”

To his surprise Charli answered, “What?”

“Did you get my message?”

“Which one.”

Damn it, he wanted her to at least give him a sign that they had a chance. “All of them. I guess the question is, do you want to have the conversation we never seemed to make time for, or should we just call it quits?” Surely she had to know he was serious about them?

Every part of him thought that Charli would agree to meet him, after all she answered the phone, had come to Brisbane surely somewhere within her heart, there was a place for him.

“I call quits,” her response hit him out of the blue. The phone went dead.

Alan’s body started shaking as he looked, dazed at Danika.

“What happened?”

“She just ended it,” he said, still in shock. “I asked her to make a decision and I guess she did.”

“What does that mean?”

“It means I don’t know what the hell I’m supposed to do.”

“It sounded like you gave her an ultimatum.”

“I was trying to make her see we needed to talk, but as of now, she’s called it quits.”

“Are you still going back to Townsville, maybe she’ll …”

He cut Danika off mid-sentence, “Why bother, I’ve got nothing there.”


Excusing himself from Danika, Alan went back into the conference and started the rounds of colleagues and former colleagues about job opportunities, surprised at the reaction. Within two hours of starting to put the feelers out, executives were pulling him aside with offers almost too good to be refused. By the end of the day he had three firm offers with contracts. One in Sydney, one in Brisbane and the last one in Perth. The Perth offer was about as far away from Townsville as he could imagine while remaining in Australia. Surely, he’d be able to start a new life without thinking of a particular nurse.

“So what are you going to do?” asked Danika when he told her about the offers.

“I don’t know,” he replied, shrugging. “I’m flying back tomorrow and I guess I hand in my resignation. I have months of annual leave that I can take in lieu of notice period and all I really need to do is pack up my home, put it in storage and start again.

“Just like that, she calls it quits and you move interstate?”

“I haven’t decided which job I’m going to take.”

“You are serious about resigning?” Danika pressed.

“The first offer looks good if it wasn’t so far away from her.” He tried to sound like that was a bad thing, even though it was the main reason he could even entertain the thought. “I’ve heard that Perth’s weather is perfect all year around.”

“You didn’t answer the question.”

“Oh, yes I did.”



Charli arrived back at work after spending the rest of her days off in bed and crying, to the hospital rumor mill in full swing.

“He’s leaving.”

“Heard he won’t even be coming back to pack up his desk.”

“Can’t imagine the base without Dr Hunter.”

“Dr Hunter, leaving?” she scoffed. “I doubt it, he’s been here forever.”

“Well, believe it,” his assistant responded when Charli couldn’t take the rumors any longer. “Apparently, the conference went well and made him realize what he could be making in private practice. He’s turned down offers before over the years, but then he had a reason to stay.” Nikita said pointedly. “Apparently, the reason is over and he’d be mad to turn down that sort of money and prestige.”

Charli wanted to be happy for him; surely she could love him enough to let him go.

“Has he actually resigned?”

“Well he’s made a time to speak to all of his direct reports and your old friend Xanthe is even coming back to help transition some of his patients into occupational therapy early.”

Charli hadn’t heard from Alan since their last phone call. Even now, she didn’t expect him to let her call “quits” over something so minor — surely her flying to Brisbane should have told him how much she cared? But why would he have given her a choice if he didn’t want to end things?

Now the base seemed full of people who knew about their relationship and blamed her for Alan leaving; or didn’t know about their relationship but still wanted someone to blame. Strangely, the respect and admiration he’d long deserved was only coming his way with rumors of him leaving.

“You okay?” Jodi found her clinging to a cold cup of tea in the break room.

“I wasn’t looking forward to coming back to work and trying to pretend nothing happened.”

“What did happen? I thought you were going to Brisbane and the two of you would come back engaged or at least living together.”

“I overreacted, and instead of having a conversation, I ended things.”

“Can’t you at least reach out to him, convince him that you can still be friends. He shouldn’t have to leave the base hospital because of a lover’s spat?”

Charli shook her head, tossing out the cold tea as just another thing she wanted but waited too long to have. “If Alan leaving means he’s finally going to get the respect and recognition he deserves, then I’ve got to love him enough to let him go.”



“Xanthe!” he met his old occupational therapist in the weights room with a huge hug. “You are a sight for sore eyes.”

“Thought I’d better come up and make sure my rehab protocol will stay in good hands if the rumors are true.”

“What rumors would that be?” He smiled, knowing how small a community Defence could be. He hadn’t even put pen to paper, yet and already Townsville was abuzz with news.

“Oh, something about you moving to Perth because you met a girl?”

For a moment, he thought she was serious, before laughing. “You’re half right. I’m leaving Townsville because of a girl, but I haven’t decided on where I’m going.”

“We should talk.” Xanthe insisted. “Italian restaurant, seven and your shout.”

“If you’re inviting me for dinner, why should I pay?”

“Because. Just because.”


“Veal saltimbocca with olive greens,” Xanthe ordered. “You’ll miss the food from here when you go.”

“Salt-crusted, wagyu strip loin with the celeriac & tarragon remoulade,” he ordered before looking towards Xanthe, “Yes, I’ll miss the food.”

After their wine glasses were filled, he waited, assuming the reason for dinner had less to do with the food and more to do with a gorgeous young nurse he’d so far managed to avoid.

“Mack wasn’t expecting you to invite us to the wedding, but we both expected there to be one by now.”

“How can you be so calm about them? I know you weren’t even on the scene when they broke up, but still?”

“I don’t know,” Xanthe shrugged. “When I got here, Mack was very protective about me and us. He made sure I found out all about his reputation and went into things with my eyes open. After his accident, well …”

“Charli loves him.” Alan waited for a reaction.

“Loved, past tense. And she’d even deny that.”

“I know what I saw.”

“Look, I don’t know whether I should show you this or not, but it seems to me that you crushed on Charli for years and are now running scared because she feels the same.”

“She feels the same about your boyfriend.”

“No, she doesn’t. Life is only complicated if you make it that way.”

Xanthe gave him her phone, scrolling up to texts between her and Charli from the time of Mack’s accident.

“She encouraged you not to give up on him?”

“Not the words of a girl holding a flame for an ex. I don’t know what I would have done without Charli in my corner. Someone who knew Mack enough to convince me to see through his darkness and to trust in what we had.”

“I never knew.”

“Keep reading.”

Text after text, Charli was asking for reassurance that she was good enough to date a doctor — that she was good enough for Dr Alan Hunter.

“All this time, I thought I was just keeping her bed warm until another soldier could come along.”

“Seriously? If she wanted a soldier, there would have been a line up at the clinic door. They are all in love with her, not that she would ever notice. It’s only been you, for the longest time.”

“I thought I was her rebound after Mack.”

“Then, for a smart doctor, you are one of the dumbest men I know.”

“What do I do?” he asked as their meals arrived.

“If you had thirty seconds to talk to her, what would you say?”



_Xanthe: Hope you like veal saltimbocca_

Charli smoothed her errant curls before opening the door to her favorite restaurant. It had been a long shot, but Xanthe had somehow convinced Alan to hear her out. Xanthe met her at the door with hugs, “I still want an invitation to the wedding.”

Charli could only hope.

Nervously, she approached the table in the back. Alan stood to hold out her seat, but she refused to sit, standing as close to him as she dared. Until she had made things right, she didn’t even want a small table to come between them.

“I don’t want you to leave, but I understand and am trying to be happy for you.”

“I didn’t have a choice — you called it quits.”

She didn’t even stop to think, the words tumbling out. “I wanted you to convince me that what we had was worth fighting for.”

“It was bloody hard when I thought I was the only one fighting.” The waitress looked over as their voices drowned out the calming background music.

“I love you.” She said calmly. The three words she’d never had the courage to say before. “I know it’s too late, and probably doesn’t mean much now that you’re leaving, but I love you.”

“Why say it, then?”

“Because I should have said it months ago, whether you felt it too or not. I was scared of putting myself out there, but Xanthe convinced me that it was better to come here tonight, tell you and that way I’ll never wonder ‘what if’.”

“What if, what?”

She paused, “Our timing had always been off, hasn’t it? We’ve both made a heap of assumptions about the past and future, instead of living in the present.”

“You could look at it like that,” he said, taking half a step towards her. Not quite bodies touching, but it felt as if the rest of the diners were watching them, holding their breath. “Or you could think that we’ve had a thousand chances to walk away, but didn’t.”

“You’re the one walking away — I heard Perth?”

“Come with me.” 

“What?” She’d hoped for a kiss “goodbye,” or at maybe to convince him to remain friends. She never dreamed he would ask her to go with him.

“You heard me. I heard you. If you love me, then the decision should be easy, come away with me.”

“But you don’t love me.” She didn’t even know why she was hesitating. Dr Alan Hunter was offering all she could hope for, even without love.

“Oh, my darling girl, I’ve been in love with you from the moment I saw you, and loved you since before our first kiss. I’ve loved you even when you are infuriating, and even when we fight and I know you’re right. I’ve loved your passion for living, how you fight for your patients and how you fought for us when I was being a jealous prick.”

Gently, he brushed her tears away. Never, had she heard him speak like this before.

“My darling Charli, how can I show you that I love you?”

“Kiss me like you mean it.”

So, he did.
