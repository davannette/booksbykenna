It's been a while since I released my last choose your own romance and I can't wait for you to read [The Perfect Wife](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NBKTXY9/ "The Perfect Wife").

Brynne Thurlow was Juliette James' friend in [The Unforgiving Wife](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FCR1K6N/ "The Unforgiving Wife"). Strong and steadfast, I wanted to know more about Brynne but didn't know what would trigger a decision point in her marriage. So, instead of her husband being drawn to another woman, what if his 'mistress' was business? Throw in the challenge of a military hero ex-boyfriend coming back to claim her heart, and I found two of my three male loves.

What Owen and Ed have in common is their alpha-male need to rule the world, one battle at a time. It only seemed fitting that Brynne's third love interest would be the opposite. Kind and caring, with the only goal in life to have a happy family.

Writing [The Perfect Wife](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NBKTXY9/ "The Perfect Wife") challenged the way I felt about marriage, which I guess is one of the reasons I love books - both reading and writing. Getting inside Owen's head made me understand that the reasons for being a workaholic may not always be obvious. I also loved bringing Ed back into Brynne's life and watching them work through feelings that had never been resolved.

Whether you believe in first love and second chances, or a forever kind of love, you'll love [The Perfect Wife](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NBKTXY9/ "The Perfect Wife").

This is what some readers have said:

"This is a unique story with multiple possibilities. It's well written and intriguing. I liked the characters and the plots. I think the author does a great job with this story; the build is good. I love the different endings that are possible" Mary

"Brynne has three men who love her. Owen and Ed have the greatest ties to her heart due to her emotional aching past history with them both. Gabriel is the man she goes to for comfort, friendship, and healing. As the story goes on, we find that Brynne loves all three men as well.
This was like reading three stories at once. I liked the novelty, but I have to admit that it took me a while to switch gears when I read the alternate endings. I think Owen’s actions had my heart breaking the most in the way he lashed out to Brynne in his pain. It’s interesting that in each alternate ending, Brynne chose the man, and then they had a chance to clear the air and be honest. She cuts the other two out of her life and never hears their reasons for their actions. It made me wonder if she heard all of their confessions how would she have chosen then? Who will she choose? Her husband of fourteen years who neglected her but always loved her? Ed, who was her first love and was everything to her? Or Gabriel, who was ready to give Brynne everything she’d ever wanted?
Very emotional romance with Brynne having to finally choose who she wants and needs the most once and for all." CS
