What kills love quicker than a slamming door sinks a sponge cake? 

Insecurity and jealousy. 

Dr Alan Hunter can never believe that the love of his life, nurse Charli Sims, can choose him over the army soldier heroes they heal. Charli can't see why the amazing and sexy doctor would choose her over - well, anyone else.

Will her past stand in the way of their future? Or will have to lose everything so that their insecurities and jealousy can finally be set aside.

I loved Xanthe's friend and Mack's ex, Charli in [Protect Her](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07J429XPV/ "Protect Her"). For me, Charli was looking for love, thought she'd found it in Mack until he proved what a man-whore he really was.

When Mack meets Xanthe, he's a changed man and Charli finally sees Dr Alan Hunter as a man, not just a colleague. 

Have you met ... Dr Hunter picks up where Protect Her leaves off - with two people destined to be together - torn apart by their own insecurities. [Have you met ... Dr Hunter]({{site.baseurl}}/book-summary/have-you-met-drhunter) is the short but not sweet romance you asked for and the sixth free monthly novella I've written just for you! 

Don't want to read it in the blog? No problems, [download](https://dl.bookfunnel.com/8ut9jp1vaf) it and get a bonus sneak peek from my military romance, Protect Her.

Enjoy!
