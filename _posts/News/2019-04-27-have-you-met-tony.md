Earlier this month, I asked you to tell me what you wanted for Tony de Marco, the piano player who pulled Sienna up on stage in [The Question Is](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BJKM8DT/ "The Question Is"). [Have you met ... Tony]({{site.baseurl}}/book-summary/have-you-met-tony) is the short but not sweet holiday romance you asked for and the fourth monthly free novel I've written just for you! 

Don't want to read it in the blog? No problems, [download](https://dl.bookfunnel.com/qjj6ee22vx) it and get a bonus sneak peak from my military romance, Protect Her.

Enjoy!
