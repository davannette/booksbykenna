What if the love of your life was waiting for you to open your eyes and see them there?
What if you said one word that shatters their heart? Could they ever forgive?
I loved Robert Zhang in [The Intern](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078ZW34LX/ "The Intern"). He has an edge that you know I like in my leading men - but also a vulnerability that makes him completely f#ckable. Sizzi was standing on the sidelines in The Intern, but now that he's noticed her, Robert's single word threatens to destroy all hope for their happily ever after. [Have you met ... Robert]({{site.baseurl}}/book-summary/have-you-met-robert) is the short but not sweet romance you asked for and the fifth monthly free novel I've written just for you! 

Don't want to read it in the blog? No problems, [download](https://dl.bookfunnel.com/vuut2dxeg0) it and get a bonus sneak peek from my military romance, Protect Her.

Enjoy!
