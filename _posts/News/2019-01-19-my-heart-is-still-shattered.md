title: My heart is still shattered
category: News
---
Shattered Hearts is now with my editor and has been the absolute toughest and most emotional book I think I'll ever write. I still don't know what to do about giving you sneak peeks. I want to, but at the same time, it is still so personal a story. Even though it is fiction, the grief is still raw even 18 years later.

I remember after our daughter died and my mother-in-law's mother wanted to talk to me. She told me about her daughter that had fought to live for 18 months before she died, still a baby. If this proud woman could cry ugly tears all those years later, it gave me permission not to 'get over' my grief in a year or two.

Yes, Shattered Hearts is still a romance, but I hope when you read it, you will feel so much more.
