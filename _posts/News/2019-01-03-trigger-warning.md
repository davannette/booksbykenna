Last April I started the toughest book I'll ever write. Now, the release date is only months away and I can't put it off any longer.

You see, almost 18 years ago, my husband and I lost a baby and in April, I held my other daughter as she cried for the loss of her teenage friend.

I wanted to honour all beloved children who didn't outlive their parents, and then thought about the parent's struggle to hold onto a marriage weighted under grief.

So, I started Shattered Hearts. I've cried more in writing which is why it has taken me so long to get back to it.

If you've lost a child, please accept my sympathy and love.
