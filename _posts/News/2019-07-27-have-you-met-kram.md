He never expected to rescue a mother and her baby. He never expected to fall in love 

After three months on the run, Laurel and her seven-month-old daughter are out of money and options. When a stranger breaks into their house, and insists he wants to help, can the insticts that have kept her alive be trusted?

Ex-commando Kram is used to getting the jobs that would give other soldiers nightmares. But he doesn't think a woman deserves to lose her life just because she left her husband. In a race against time, finding the ex-wife is easier than maintaining a professional distance. But is it Kram the soldier or Kram, a man in love, who faces down the ex-husband willing to pull the trigger.

If you loved Kram in Defend Her, then enjoy him in Have You Met ... Kram.

**Why did I want to write about Kram?**

I loved writing [Defend Her](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TSTD7N3/ "Defend Her"). The whole military suspense part of romance was fun to write, especially making sure Anastacia's ex-husband got what he deserved. For me, Defend Her introduced a number of new soldiers and former military who deserved their own chance at love. Kram is the first, but who will be next?

[Have you met ... Kram]({{site.baseurl}}/book-summary/have-you-met-kram) is the short but not sweet romance you asked for and the seventh free monthly novella I've written just for you!
